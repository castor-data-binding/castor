CASTOR
======

Castor integrates Java objects, XML documents and SQL relational
databases in a unified model that allows information to be exchanged, 
persisted and manipulated in a variety of ways.

Castor - simplifying the exchange and persistence of information!

This release of Castor includes the following persistence/
exchange modules:

Castor XML  -- Java data binding / object to XML document 
               mapping. Source Code Generation. 

Castor JDO  -- Java object to SQL relational database
               (aka object/ relational) mapping

Note: There are individuals who are working on reviving
the DSML module and hopefully it'll be back in a future
release.
