    <p>This package represents an API, based on a set of articles in the O'Reilly Network
       by William Grosso, to implement a simplified and 1.3-compatible implementation of
       a Hashbelt algorithm.</p>

	<p>Hashbelts are simple, in principle. Instead of walking all objects and finding out
       when they're supposed to expire, use a "conveyor belt" approach. At any particular
       point in time, objects going into the cache go into the front of the conveyor belt.
       After a certain amount of time or when the size limit of a container has been
       reached, move the conveyor belt - put a new, empty container at the front of the
       conveyor belt to catch new objects, and the one that drops off of the end of the
       conveyor belt is, by definition, ready for garbage collection.</p>
	
	<p>As seen in his system, you can use a set of pluggable strategies to implement the
       actual hashbelt bits. A container strategy allows you to change out the
       implementation of the container itself - from simple hashtable-based
       implementations, up through more complex uses of soft referenced or hashset-based
       implementations, depending on what you need and what you want it to be used for.
       A pluggable "expire behavior" handler allows you to determine what action is taken
       on something which drops off of the bottom of the conveyor belt.</p>
