    <p>A persistence service provider implements the {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.spi.Persistence}
       interface, allowing the cache engine to load, store, create and remove objects
       to the underlying storage mechanism.</p>

    <p>A query expression is constructed using {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.spi.QueryExpression},
       which accepts query paramteres and constructs the proper query statement.
       The query expression is fed to a {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.spi.PersistenceQuery}
       object that is used to perform the actual query and retrieve the query results.</p>

    <p>Both implementations are obtained from a {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.spi.PersistenceFactory},
       which is set once for each type of database and is configured using Bean-like
       accessor methods. Each persistent storage mechanism will require one factory
       implementation. The factories are specified in the Castor properties file.</p>

    <p>Castor supports many schemes for key generation through a simple
       {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.spi.KeyGenerator} interface.</p>
