/**
 * The persistence engine implements this interface in order to allow
 * objects to be created, removed, loaded, stored, locked and checked
 * for dirtyness.
 * <p>
 * The caller takes full responsibility to assure integrity of
 * transactions and object caching and only relies on the engine to
 * assist in assuring that through the mechanisms available to it.
 * <p>
 * All method calls provide an open connection into the persistence
 * storage. The connection is opened by and maintained in the context
 * of a transaction. The type of the connection depends on the
 * persistence engine (JDBC, JNDI, etc).
 * <p>
 * All method calls provide the object fields and the object identity.
 * The engine must always use the identity passed in the method call
 * and never the identity contained in the object itself.
 * <p>
 * The stamp is an arbitrary object that is returned on object
 * creation and loading and passed when performing a dirty check. The
 * stamp can be used to detect object dirtyness in a more efficient
 * manner in database that support a stamping mechanism (e.g. Oracle
 * RAWID, Sybase TIMESTAMP).
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this object must be re-entrant and thread
 * safe. It must depend on the connection passed in each method call
 * and never hold a reference to a connection.
