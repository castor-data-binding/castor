    <p>The Castor persistence engine handles object persistence, object
       caching, transaction concurrency and locking. This package is not used directly
       by application developer, and includes the interfaces, implementations and
       persistence exceptions.</p>

    <p>The persistence engine API is used by the application APIs (JDO, CMP, DAX) to implement
       caching, queries, transactions and concurrency, etc. This layer is shared by all persistence
       engine and exposes a unified interface for use as a persistence engine for EJB CMP.</p>

    <p>An application API will use a {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.TransactionContext} in order
       to perform operations. All operations against the persistence engine are transactional.
       The persistence engine is obtained through the {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.PersistenceEngineFactory}
       class which returns a {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.LockEngine}. The factory requires
       a factory of persistence SPIs (see <a href="spi/package-summary.html">SPI</a>.</p>

    <p>{@link org.exolab.castor.persist.LockEngine} implements a persistence engine that caches
       objects in memory for performance, and eliminates the number of persistent storage operations.
       In order to speed up interaction between the engines and the object, {@link
       org.exolab.castor.persist.ClassMolder} is constructed to represent a flat view 
       of the object graph that is efficient to process.</p>

    <p>If the application API supports enlistment as an XA resource, it will use
       {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.XAResourceImpl} and implement {@link
       org.exolab.castor.persist.XAResourceSource} for automatic enlistment/delistment with a
       transaction context.</p>

    <p>The remainder of this package are persistence exceptions and concurrency engine
       implementation.</p>
