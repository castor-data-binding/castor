/**
 * HIGH-LOW key generator factory.
 * The short name of this key generator is "HIGH-LOW".
 * It uses the following alrorithm: a special sequence table must be in 
 * the database with keeps the maximum key values. The name of the 
 * sequence table is a mandatory parameter of the key generator, 
 * the parameter name is "table".
 * The name of the primary key column of the sequence table and 
 * the name of the column in which maximum values are stored are 
 * mandatory parameters with the names "key-column" and "value-column",
 * respectively. The key column contains table names, so it must be of
 * a character type (char or varchar). The value column contains primary key
 * values, it must be of a numeric type (numeric or int).
 * Key generator reads the maximum value X for the given table, 
 * writes the new value (X + N) to the sequence table and during next N 
 * calls returns values X + 1, ..., X + N without database access.
 * Number N (which sometimes is called "grab size") is an optional
 * parameter of the key generator, the parameter name is "grab-size",
 * default value is "1".
 * For example, if you want to obtain HIGH-LOW key generator with  
 * 3 digits in the LOW part of the key, you should set "grab-size" to "1000".
