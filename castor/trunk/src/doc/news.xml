                in the XML code generation area (incl some restructuring of the HTML docs in 
                this very area as well).<br/><br/>

            <title>Jira and notifications</title>

                This is a short message for those who have created Jira issues in the
                past two or three months or so, or have commented upon existing issues.<br/><br/>
                
                It looks like during some Jira upgrade a few months ago, a couple of
                Jira settings got disabled. As a result, the original reporter of a Jira
                issue did not get notified about any changes to the issue (incl. e.g.
                state changes, comments, questions, etc.).<br/><br/>
                
                I have now reconfigured the notification scheme attached to the Castor
                Jira instance so that the following entities will receive notification
                emails upon a change to an issue:<br/><br/>
                
                - The SCM mailing list (somewhat high traffic)<br/>
                - The reporter of the issue<br/>
                - The assignee of the issue<br/>
                - All watchers.<br/><br/>
                
                I hope that this will shorten feedback loops substantially in the
                future, and I would like to ask people who created issues in the last
                two or three months to 'manually' scan the issues they created for
                updates et alias.

                As you might (not) have noticed, all the project-related infrastructure
                (mailing lists, SVN repository, HTML docs, binaries etc.) has been
                off-line due to a hard disk failure on one of the Codehaus
                servers. As a result of a lot of dedication from the Codehaus folks, 
                we are as of now in a position to re-start life as usual.<br/><br/>
                
                Please note that there's still a few minor issues related to things
                being setup and/or re-instated as we speak. As such, we won't be
                updating some HTML docs immediately, as a few things have not come to
                reach final stability yet.<br/><br/>
                
                Please watch this page and the mailing list(s) for more updates.

                you'll find some suggestions we find suitable for the program, and per
                definition we would be glad to support a few projects.<br/><br/>
                
                Please understand, though, that mentoring capacities will be limited,
                though we will try to dedicate as much time as possible to the suggested
                projects. That implies that we depend on your dedication during the
                preparation of the detailed specification and description of the outcome.<br/><br/>
                
                The timeframe for applications is May 1 - May 8. So have a look at the
                projects at offer, before you are sign up to the program and apply as a
                student to be mentored by us.

                On April 14. 2006 we have migrated Castor source repository from CVS
                to SVN. At the moment we still have read only access to CVS but this
                does not reflect commits to SVN after the migration. The read only
                access to CVS is intended for you to create patches of your current
                work and move it over to SVN. Be aware that we will switch off CVS soon.

                For details about SVN access please have a look at:

            <summary>
                One of the major short-comings of Castor JDO always has been missing support for 
                polymorphism. After the 0.9.6 release back in Februray, which mainly focused on bug 
                fixing, we decided to tackle this missing feature and start work for adding 
                support for polymorphism to Castor JDO. For a complete history of the work done so 
                far and the tests conducted, please have a look at 
                <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=CASTOR-1018">bug 1881</a>.<br/><br/>

                As of last week, most of the work (originally initiated by myself) has been 
                finished, and we are now in a position where we'd like to ask you, our users, 
                for feedback. In other words, we think that the current implementation is stable enough 
                to make it available as described below. But as we want to get this new feature 
                as stable as possible before heading for a new release (most likely 0.9.7, but 
                maybe 1.0), we now need feedback from our users.<br/><br/>

                To facilitate this, I've made available binaries 
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/previews/0.9.6_with_polymorphism/">here</a>. 
                Please use the source distribution if possible, as it contains the tests mentioned above 
                as well.

                I've placed a copy of the first Castor 0.9.6 release candidate on the
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/0.9.6/">FTP Server</a>.<br/><br/>

                This is mainly a bug fix release, but includes a couple of new features as
                well. For details about the bugs fixed and features provided, please have
                a look at (an interim version of) the
                <a href="http://brainopolis.dnsalias.com/castorwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ReleaseNotes096">release notes</a>.<br/><br/>

                The release candidate will be replaced by the official version within the
                next three or four weeks, so please try this version and report any
                regression issues (where applicable). A regression for this release is something
                that was working in 0.9.5.4 but no longer is working in this 0.9.6 release
                candidate. Only regression issues will be considered for fixing before the final
                0.9.6 release.<br/><br/>

                All other bugs will be moved out to 0.9.7, or a 0.9.6.x sub-release if necessary.

                I've placed a copy of the latest Castor 0.9.5.4 release candidate on the
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/0.9.5.4/">FTP Server</a>.

                This is a bug fix release, so please do not expect new features
                slated for 0.9.6 to appear in this release. The release candidate
                will be replaced by the official version by end of the week, so
                please try this version and report any regression issues. A
                regression for this release is something that was working in 0.9.5.3
                but no longer working in this 0.9.5.4 release candidate. Only
                regression issues will be considered for fixing before the final
                release. All other bugs will be moved out to 0.9.6, or a 0.9.5.5
                release if necessary.

               <br/>
               <br/>
               Message boards are typically more user-friendly than mailing lists
               as they keeps the information in a much more organized fashion and don't
               add to our ever increasing inboxes.
               <br/>
               The mailing lists will continue to remain open and you can choose which
               ever communication method you prefer.

                did not make the X.Y.Z release due to time constraints.
