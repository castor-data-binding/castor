    <title>Castor JDO Long Transactions Support</title>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <p>The usual Castor transactions are called here short
         transactions: an object is read, modified and written within the
         bounds of one transaction.
         Long transactions consist of two Castor transactions:
         an object is read in the first and written in the second.
         Between them the object is sent "outwards" and modified there.
         For example, the object may be send to a client application and
         dispayed to a user, or it may be sent to a servlet engine and is
         displayed on a web page. After that the modified object returns
         back and is written to the database in the second transaction.
         At this point the object is usually not the same physical instance
         as one that was read in the first transaction.
         The example code for writing the object in the second Castor
         transaction follows:
         <code>
    <comment>
    // a customer go to a webpage to review her personal information.
    // The servlet then call this server side function: getCustomerInfo</comment>
    public CustomerInfo getCustomerInfo( Integer customNum ) {
         <comment>
             // in most case, users simply review information and
             // make no change. Even if they make changes, it often
             // takes time for them to decide. We don't want to
             // lock the database row, so commit right after we load.</comment>
         db.begin();
         CustomerInfo info = (CustomerInfo)
            db.load( CustomerInfo.class, customNum );

         <comment>
                 // we also want to keep track of customers patterns
                 // well...it helps us provide better service.</comment>
         info.setLastVisit( today );
         db.commit();
         return info;
    }

    <comment>
        // Three days passed, the indecisive customer finally agrees to
        // marry Joe. She changes her last name in the webpage and
        // clicked the "Submit" button on the webpage.
    </comment>

    <comment>
        // The servlet then calls updateCustomerInfo to update the
        // last name for the indecisive customer.</comment>
    public void updateCustomerInfo( CustomerInfo info ) {
        db.begin();
        db.update(info);
        db.commit();
    }
         </code>
         Note, that it is natural to read the object in the first
         transaction in the read-only mode.
      </p>
      <p>Since the time interval between the first and the second
         transaction is relatively big, it is desirable to perform dirty
         checking, i.e. to check that the object has not been modified
         in the database during the long transaction.
         For that the object must hold a timestamp: it is set by
         Castor during the first Castor transaction and is checked during
         the second one.
         In order to enable the dirty checking for long transactions,
         the object should implement the interface
         org.exolab.castor.jdo.TimeStampable
         having two methods: <code>long jdoGetTimeStamp()</code> and
         <code>void jdoSetTimeStamp(long timeStamp)</code>

         <!--
         There are two types of timestamps: local (in the Castor cache) and
         global (in the database).
         Respectively, the are two dirty checking algorithms:
         bounded and reliable.
         They are decribed below in details.
         The reliable dirty checking isn't implemented yet.
         -->
      </p>
    </section>

    <section title="Bounded dirty checking">
      <p>The advantage of the bounded dirty checking is that it doesn't require
         any changes to the database schema. It uses the Castor cache to store
         object timestamps. The disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is
         bounded by a lifetime of the cached copy of the object. After the
         cached copy has been purged, db.update() causes ObjectModifiedException.
      </p>

      <p>Thus, parameters of the cache define dirty checking capabilities.
         The cache-type attribute is part of the
         <a href="jdo-mapping.html#The-&lt;class&gt;-element">
         &lt;class> element</a> in the XML mapping. Consider the existing cache types:
         <ul>
           <li>none - the bounded dirty checking is impossible
           </li>
           <li>count-limited - the count limit for the cache is a count
           limit for the objects of this class that can participate in long
           and short transactions simultaneously.
           </li>
           <li>time-limited - the time limit for the cache is a time limit
           for the long transaction.
           </li>
           <li>unlimited - the bounded dirty checking gives correct results
           while the cache exists, i.e. until the crash of the server.
           </li>
         </ul>
       </p>
    </section>

    <!--section title="Reliable dirty checking">
      <p>In order to use the reliable dirty checking, you have to add a
         timestamp field to the database table.
         Some database servers (e.g., Sybase and MS SQL Server) support
         timestamp fields automatically.
         For other databases you should add a NUMERIC field and a
         trigger that increases the field's value on UPDATE.
         And the last possibility is to tell Castor to increase the field
         value on UPDATEs.
      </p>

    <section title="Long transactions that do not depend on cache">
		<p>For long transactions (detached objects) it was required 
      	that the entity has been kept in cache from being loaded until its update. 
      	If the entity was expired from cache before the update an 
      	ObjectModifiedException had been thrown. While this is no 
      	problem if all entities of an application can be kept in 
      	cache all the time, it is one for large scale applications 
      	with millions of entities.
	</p><p>
		With release 1.3 we have changed the handling of timestamps. 
		While it is still possible to rely on cache only it is now 
		also possible to persist the timestamp together with the 
		other properties of the entity. Doing so will ensure that 
		the timestamp do not change even if the entity got expired 
		from cache from being loaded until it gets updated. If this 
		happens the entity gets reloaded during update which also 
		loads the previous timestamp. Having said that it still is 
		possible that an ObjectModifiedException is thrown when 
		another user has changed the same entity in the meantime.

      </p>

public class Entity implements TimeStampable {
    private Integer _id;
    private String _name;
    private long _timeStamp;
    
    public Integer getId() { return _id; }
    public void setId(final Integer id) { _id = id; }
    
    public String getName() { return _name; }
    public void setName(final String name) { _name = name; }
    
    public long getTimeStamp() { return _timeStamp; }
    public void setTimeStamp(final long timeStamp) {
        _timeStamp = timeStamp;
    }
    
    public long jdoGetTimeStamp() { return _timeStamp; }
    public void jdoSetTimeStamp(final long timestamp) {
        _timeStamp = timestamp;
    }
