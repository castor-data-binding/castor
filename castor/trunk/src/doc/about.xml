    <section title="About the Castor Project">

      <p>
        The Castor project has been developed out of need: the need to get stuff done
        and the need to write useful code. It has been designed and coded over many cups
        of Dunkin Donut's Hazlenut coffee, Starbucks' Latte, and tall no-whip White Mochas,
        as proof that coffee beans do come in handy.  A few rogue contributors prefer
        the sweetness of Coca Cola to the bitterness of coffee.

        The Castor Project was started and originally developed by
        <a href="mailto:keith AT kvisco DOT com">Keith Visco</a> and
        <a href="mailto:arkin@remove-no-spam.intalio.com">Assaf Arkin</a> of Intalio, Inc.
        Contributors are welcome to join this project. Please join us on the
        <a href="lists.xml">mailing list</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Castor makes use of and includes several third-party software components such as
        Xerces, Jakarta ORO, and Jakarta Regexp, all developed by the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
        Castor also makes use of and includes the
        <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit testing framework</a>, which is only
        used in the build and testing components.
