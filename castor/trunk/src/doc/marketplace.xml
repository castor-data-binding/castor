    <section title="Introduction">

       <p>As <a href="support.html">already</a> explained, Castor is an 
          open-source product. This means that the source code is available at 
          no charge and may be obtained using <a href="scm.xml">CVS</a> or
         <a href="download.xml">downloaded</a> via 
         <url>http://dist.codehaus.org/castor</url>.</p>

       <p>Due to the nature of the project, there is no guaranteed level of 
          support (of commercial quality) offered by the project and its 
          community. As outlined <a href="support.html">here</a>, the online
          <a href="index.html">documentation</a> is the best place to 
          start.</p>

       <p>Having said that, it is noteworthy to mention that there's plenty of 
        companies out there that offer ...</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>(commercial) products based on Castor</li>
            <li>consulting services related to various aspects of Castor</li>
            <li>commercial support related to Castor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This page provides you with various reference points, addressing 
           most of the above areas. This includes a directory of companies
           offering (commercial) services, a directory of success-stories 
           (highlighting the (commercial) use of Castor in the industry), etc.</p>      
           
        <p>We hope that the information provided is of value to you, our customers,
           and we are more than happy to discuss any suggestions/recommendations
           related to this offering.</p>

    <section title="Use of Castor in other open source projects">
        
        <p>This section identifies various (mainly) open source projects where 
           Castor is used and/or that offer tight integration with Castor or
           parts thereof.</p>
           
        <h3><a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Apache Cocoon</a></h3>
            
            <p>Apache Cocoon is a web publishing framework built around the 
               concepts of separation of concerns and component-based web 
               development.</p>

            <p>As part of this framework, Cocoon provides a component, the 
               <b>CastorTransformer</b>, that marshalls an object hierarchy (for 
               which a mapping file or a class descriptor hierarchy exists) to 
               XML and inserts it as a stream of SAX events into a Cocoon 
               pipeline.</p>

            <p>Further information on the integration of Apache Cocoon and
               Castor can be found <a href="projects.xml">here</a>.</p>

                "As a developer of international financial management and
                procurement systems, CODA started a project to XML-enable our Financials
                application server," noted Andrew Fawcett of CODA. "We made two major
                technology decisions. The first was to use the W3C XML Schema to
                describe our XML messages. The second was to facilitate the use of an
                XML Data Binding framework. This allows our developers to process XML
                messages in a more productive and intuitive way within their programs,
                without requiring extensive training and experience with XML or its
                traditional APIs such as SAX or DOM. In performing an analysis of XML
                Data Binding frameworks, we found that Castor was the only
                implementation at the time that met our needs in terms of its support
                for W3C XML Schema and its ability to integrate with our Web
                infrastructure." 
                
                "In addition," Fawcett continued, "we use Castor internally within our
                Web client-enabling framework (based on the Java Servlet API). Java
                source code produced by the Castor source code generator is used to
                dynamically bind data to our Web forms. The resulting data can then be
                marshaled directly between our Web applications and application server."

                Syscon is primarily concerned with the developement of custom-build/purpose-build
                software solutions and the design of database systems since its foundation in 1996.
                For 4 years we have been developing Java applications in enterprise environment.
                For these applications, we frequently use our own client/server framework side by
                side with open source projects such as the data binding framework Castor, where
                one of our engineers is an active committer.
