    <title>Castor Support</title>

    <section title="Introduction">
       <p>Castor is an open-source product. This means that the source code is
          available at no charge and may be obtained using <a href="scm.xml">CVS</a> or
         <a href="download.xml">downloaded</a> via our ftp server.</p>
	   
       <p>Since castor is freely available, including the source code,
          there is no guaranteed level of support available. The online
          <a href="#Documentation">documentation</a> is
          the best place to start. If you have trouble or have more advanced
          questions not available in the online documentation then please subscribe
          to the <a href="lists.xml">castor dev or user mailing lists</a> or join the
          <a href="/phpBB2">Castor Forums</a>. The lists and forums are the best
          place to ask questions about the product.</p>
	   
	   <p>Due to our move to <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">the Codehaus</a> in January 
		  2005, we greatly benefit from the infrastructure available at this site, and are
		  in a position to offer you to join us on the #castor IRC channel at 
		  irc.codehaus.org, where you'll mainly be able to talk to committers and
		  fellow users/developers exchanging ideas and bouncing off problems.</p>
		  
		<p>Please note though, that for problems of any kind, you should still use one of 
		   the mailing list as your prefered way of communicating to us.</p>
