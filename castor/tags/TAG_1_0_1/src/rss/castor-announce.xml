                This is a short message for those who have created Jira issues in the
                past two or three months or so, or have commented upon existing issues.
                
                It looks like during some Jira upgrade a few months ago, a couple of
                Jira settings got disabled. As a result, the original reporter of a Jira
                issue did not get notified about any changes to the issue (incl. e.g.
                state changes, comments, questions, etc.)...

			<title>Castor up again ...</title>

                As you might (not) have noticed, all the project-related infrastructure
                (mailing lists, SVN repository, HTML docs, binaries etc.) has been
                off-line due to a hard disk failure on one of the Codehaus
                servers. As a result of a lot of dedication from the Codehaus folks, 
                we are as of now in a position to re-start life as usual.

			<title>Google Summer of Code and Castor</title>
			<pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2006 13:07:43 GMT</pubDate>
			<author>Werner Guttmann</author>
			<link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item41</link>
			<description>
                we are proud to participate in the Summer of Code initiative
                (http://code.google.com/soc/) sponsored by Google, and you are invited
                to join in the fun.
                
                At http://docs.codehaus.org/display/CASTOR/CastorSocProjects, you'll
                find some suggestions we find suitable for the program, and per
                definition we would be glad to support a few projects.
                
                Please understand, though, that mentoring capacities will be limited,
                though we will try to dedicate as much time as possible to the suggested
                projects. That implies that we depend on your dedication during the
                preparation of the detailed specification and description of the outcome.
                
                The timeframe for applications is May 1 - May 8. So have a look at the
                projects at offer, before you are sign up to the program and apply as a
                student to be mentored by us.

			<title>New source repository</title>
			<pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2006 13:07:43 GMT</pubDate>

			<description>
                On April 14. 2006 we have migrated Castor source repository from CVS
                to SVN. At the moment we still have read only access to CVS but this
                does not reflect commits to SVN after the migration. The read only
                access to CVS is intended for you to create patches of your current
                work and move it over to SVN. Be aware that we will switch off CVS soon.

                For details about SVN access please have a look at:

            <title>Werner Guttmann Promoted to Castor JDO Lead</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item28</link>
            <description>
                After having lead Castor JDO since 2002, Bruce has decided to
                pass the torch to Werner Guttmann. Werner has been a force on 
                the project since he began contributing and his tireless efforts 
                are exactly what the project needs to continue. Congratulations, 
                Werner and keep up the great work!

            <title>New Castor roadmap</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item27</link>
            <description>
                For information about upcoming Castor releases and future development areas in general,
                please have a look at the Castor roadmap at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel
                As it stands right now, this will reveal that we have scheduled two releases (0.9.7
                and 0.9.9) within the next 5 weeks, the former designated to be a maintenance release 
                for Castor 0.9.6, the latter planned as a feature release with quite some new 
                features and improvements to be added.

            <description>
                Many of you will have recognized by now that the exolab.org 
                domain had been voided as of last Friday. As a result of this, 
                the Castor user forums are not available. Please accept our apologies 
                for any inconvenience you are experiencing, and rest assured that 
                we are working to get it back online as soon as possible.

                This is to announce that we finally moved our issue tracking tool from
                http://bugzilla.exolab.org to the Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org), 
                migrating to Jira at the same time. We'd like to offer our apologies 
                for any inconvenience you experienced as a result of this migration 
                and hope that you like our new home for tracking (and resolving) issues
                at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR as much as we do.

            <title>Support for polymorphism - A test drive</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item23</link>
            <description>
                One of the major short-comings of Castor JDO always has been missing support for 
                polymorphism. As of last week, most of the work has been finished, and we are now 
                in a position where we'd like to ask you, our users, for feedback. I've made 
                available binaries at http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/previews/0.9.6_with_polymorphism/. 
                Please use the source distribution if possible, as it contains the tests mentioned above 
                as well.

                the old lists at Exolab, mainly referring you to the lists mentioned above. After 
                this period, we will turn off these lists at our discretion. For details, please

            <description>After over five years of Exolab (http://www.exolab.org)sponsoring Castor, 
                the Castor team recently decided to move the entire project to a new home over at 
                the Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org). The team would like to thank Exolab and it's 
                parent company Intalio, Inc. for it's long-standing support of the project.

            <description>Please join me to welcome Gregory, Martin, Ralf and Stein as new committers
                for Castor JDO. I am more than happy to have them on board, as all of them 
                have shown their dedication to the project through numerous occasions (incl.
                patches and willingness to spend time with me and Bruce ...).
