    <p>As explained in {@link org.exolab.castor.jdo.persist}, 
       {@link org.exolab.castor.persist.LockEngine} implements a persistence engine 
       that caches objects in memory for performance reasons and thus eliminates the 
       number of operations against the persistence storage.

    <p>The main component of this package is the interface {@link Cache.java}, which declares 
       the external functionality of a performance cache. Existing (and future) cache engines
       have to implement this interface, which is closely modelled after {@link java.util.Map}. 
       To obtain an instance of a particular cache engine (from client code), client code is 
       instructed to use {@link CacheFactory} as a factory.</p>

    <p>The remainder of this package are exceptions associated with cache interaction, an 
       enumeration of all (currently) available cache types and a prototype for an (abstract) 
       base class to assist future cache engine additions.</p>
