    <title>Castor JDO FAQ</title>

    <section title="Castor's relation to other specifications">

        <section title="Does Castor JDO comply with the SUN JSR-000012 specification?">
            <p>
            No, Castor JDO doesn't comply with the SUN's JDO specification.
            </p>

            <p>
            Although Castor JDO carries very similar goals as SUN's JDO, it has 
            been developed independently from the JSR.
            </p>

            <p>
            Although it is not impossible to shape (perhaps "hammer" is a more 
            descriptive verb) Castor JDO into the SUN's JDO specification, there 
            are several major technical differences which make it unfavorable to 
            do so. Castor is RDBMS centric. Each persistence object loaded by 
            Castor is locked. Locks in Castor are observable, meaning that locks 
            may not be granted because of timeout or deadlock. On the other 
            hand, the SUN's JDO hides details about locks.
            </p>

            <p>
            Internally, Castor JDO maintains a single copy of lock (and cache) 
            for each active persistence object for all transaction. SUN's JDO 
            specification implicitly requires a copy of cache per object per 
            transaction. SUN's JDO also implicitly requires a bytecode modifier 
            which Castor doesn't require.
            </p>

            <p>
            Castor also provides other features, such as key generators, long 
            transaction support and OQL query which cannot be found in SUN's JSR.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Is Castor JDO better than EJB CMP?">
            <p>
            The relation between JDO and EJB Container-Managed
            Persistence is more complicated than simply saying, "one
            is better than the other".
            </p>

            <p>
            An Entity Bean may manage persistence itself - the EJB
            specification calls this Bean Managed Persistence
            (BMP). Alternatively, the Entity Bean may rely on an EJB
            container to manage all peersistence automatically - the
            EJB specification calls this Container Managed Persistence
            (CMP). When implementing BMP, an Entity Bean may use
            Castor JDO as its persistence mechanism, or it may use
            others methods, such as dealing with JDBC directly.
            During CMP, an EJB Container vendor may implement their
            CMP on top of Castor JDO.  In such an implementation,
            Castor JDO will be used to persist the Entity Bean.
            </p>

            <p>
            If a developer would like to take advantage of an EJB's
            life-cycle management, security, the "write once deploy
            anywhere" promise and other distributed business
            application facilities, then EJB will be the right
            choice. Otherwise, the fact that Castor is simple, is Open
            Source (you can always include Castor in your application
            or product), has much less overhead, provides more design
            freedom, and is integrated with Castor XML may be enough
            of a reason to choose Castor JDO.

    <section title="XML related questions">

        <section title="Is it possible to make XML marshalling transactionally using Castor?">
            <p>
            No. The decision of putting XML and JDO together is NOT intended to 
            make XML marshalling transactional. Instead, the integration is done 
            to help developers of a typical client-server situation whereby an 
            application server receives incoming XML messages, process the 
            messages and replies to the client.
            </p>

            <p>
            With Castor, incoming XML messages can be unmarshaled into data 
            objects. Required information can be obtained from a database using 
            JDO in form of data objects. With this approach, all data 
            manipulation can be done in an object-oriented way. Changes to JDO 
            data objects can be committed transactionally, and result data 
            objects can be marshaled into XML and returned to the client. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Is it possible to do queries on a XML file using Castor?">
            <p>
            No, Castor does not provide an OQL query facility on a XML file. If 
            querying is important for you, you should consider using a DBMS to store 
            your data instead of using XML files, especially if querying performance 
            is a concern.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another alternative is parse an XML Document directly and use XPath to
            retrieve Nodes and/or NodeSets from an XML Document.  Other open source
            tools which provide this functionality are:
            <ul>

    <section title="Technical questions">

        <section title="Where can I find some examples to start with?">
            <p>
            Download the full SVN snapshot and look into the src/tests/jdo 
            directory.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="I have encountered problems using Sun JDBC-ODBC bridge with Castor...">
            <p>
            It cannot be used with Castor, because it doesn't allow more than one
            open <tt>ResultSet</tt> at the same time. Either use JDBC driver of type &gt; 1, 
            or use some other JDBC-ODBC bridge without such a restriction
            (for example, from <a href="http://www.easysoft.com">Easysoft</a>).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="My get-method for the Collection of dependent objects returns null. Why?">

            <p>You should initialize the Collection yourself:
            <code><![CDATA[
private Collection _children = new ArrayList();

public Collection getChildren() {
    return _children;
}
            ]]></code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Should my JDO classes implement some special interface?">
            <p>
            In general, no. If you need some behavior that is not directly 
            supported by Castor, you can implement interface 
            <tt>org.exolab.castor.jdo.Persistent</tt>. In order to use dirty 
            checking for long transaction you should implement interface 
            <tt>org.exolab.castor.jdo.TimeStampable</tt>. If you need an example 
            of use of these interfaces, see Persistent.java and 
            TestPersistent.java among Castor JDO tests.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Can Castor automatically create/remove related objects?">
            <p>
            First of all, let's agree upon terminology. We distinguish dependent 
            and independent objects:

            <ul type="bullet">
                <li><b>dependent</b> objects are bounded to the parent object's lifecycle</li>
                <li><b>independent</b> objects have independent lifecycle</li>
            </ul>

            Thus, dependent objects are created/removed automatically, when 
            their parent object is created/removed, while all operations on 
            independent objects should be performed explicitly.
            </p>

            <p>
            However, with Castor 0.8.x you cannot describe explicitly the kind 
            of object. Instead, the following rule applies: if you have 
            one-to-many relation, and each side of the relation refers to 
            another (Collection attribute on "one" side, simple attribute on 
            "many" side), then "many" side is a dependent object. All other 
            objects are independent. In particular, related objects via 
            one-to-one relation are not created/removed automatically.
            </p>

            <p>
            With Castor 0.9 dependent objects should be described via "depends" 
            attribute of "class" element in mapping configuration file.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you wish some independent object was created and/or removed 
            automatically on operations on other independent object, you may 
            use interface Persistent to code the desired behavior.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Is Castor JDO using any connection pooling mechanism to improve the overall performance?">
            <p>
            No, Castor JDO doesn't have any built-in JDBC resource pooling. 
            However the framework can transparently use any resource pooling 
            facilities provided through DataSource implementation or 
            -even better- through JDNI. In fact we even recommend people to use 
            some Connection and PreparedStatement pool with Castor as this can
            increase Castor's performance 3-5 fold.
            </p>

            <p>
            For example the following set of statements:
            <code><![CDATA[
db.begin();
db.execute(...)
db.commit()
            ]]></code>
            will be executed in much less time with the resource pooling because it 
            will avoid creating a new physical JDBC connection at every execution.
            </p>

            <p>
            With Oracle, instead of specifying the usual JDBC driver you can use a
            DataSource that specifically provides some Connection caching/pooling.
            </p>

        <p>Thus if your jdo config file looks like :
        <code><![CDATA[
        <database name="..." engine="oracle" >
            <driver class-name="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
                    URL="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:TEST" >
                <param name="user" value="SYSTEM"/>
                <param name="password" value="manager"/>
            </driver>
            ...
        </database>
        ]]></code>
        then it can be changed into (for example):
        <code><![CDATA[
        <database name="..." engine="oracle" >
            <data-source class-name="oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleConnectionCacheImpl">
                <params URL="jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:TEST"
                        user="scott" 
                        password="tiger"
                />
            </data-source>
            ...
        </database>
        ]]></code>
        </p>

            <p>
            When Castor is used inside a Container such as an EJB container 
            (within BMP or Session Bean), then the Container usually provides 
            the JDBC resource through the JNDI ENC, which implicitely includes 
            pooling facilities.

        <section title="I am getting ClassNotFoundException for my JDO class, but it is in the class path. Why?">
            <p>
            Probably castor.jar file is in jre/lib/ext directory. In this case 
            you should call:
             <code>
      jdo.setClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader());
             </code>
           before jdo.getDatabase().
           </p>
        </section>

        <section title="I am getting exception 'the class ... is not persistence capable...'. Why?">
            <p>
            In this case as well as in many others you can get more information 
            with the help of logging. Call:
            </p>
        <code>
  jdo.setLogWriter(Logger.getSystemLogger());
        </code>
            <p>
            and seek in the output for warnings and errors.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="I call db.remove() on the dependent object and commit, but this doesn't work...">
            <p>
            You should not add/remove dependent objects directly. In order to 
            add/remove the dependent object you should just add/remove it from the 
            collection in the master object and call db.commit()
            </p>

            <p>
            Dependent objects cannot be created/removed explicitly. It's created 
            automatically when it is added to a master object, and removed 
            automatically when it de-linked/dereferenced from a master object.
            </p>

            <p>
            Otherwise, we will be encounter into problem where a dependent object 
            created explicitly but removed implicitly (delinked from a master object), 
            or vice versa. It can also lead to other problems that are harder to 
            detect.

        <section title="How should I represent string/date/boolean literals in OQL query?">
            <p>
            It is recommended to replace literals with parameters and to set them 
            via <tt>OQLQuery.bind()</tt>, for example:
            </p>
            <code><![CDATA[
OQLQuery query = db.getOQLQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p "
      +"WHERE name LIKE $1 AND dob>$2 AND married=$3");
query.bind("John %");
query.bind((new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd"))
       .parse("1960-01-01"));
query.bind(false);

        <section title="I get 'java.lang.AbstractMethodError: getBigDecimal' for numeric fields. Why?">
            <p>

        </section>

        <a name="bi-directional" />
        <section title="Does Castor support both one-way and two-way relationships?">
            <p>
            Typcially a relationship between two objects is either one-way (aka 
            uni-directional) or two-way (aka bi-directional). Officially, Castor 
            currently only supports bi-directional relationships. For example, 
            if an <tt>Order</tt> object contains a reference to a <tt>LineItem</tt> 
            object, the <tt>LineItem</tt> object must contain a reference to the 
            Order object. However, this requirement is not enforced in all situations. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This is a very complex problem to solve. So until Castor is expanded 
            the support uni-directional relationships, the best policy is to 
            implement the bi-directionalality for all relationships. This will 
            ensure proper functionality.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="I have an object that holds a relation to itself. Does Castor support this?">
            <p>
            This is a very common occurrence in an object model and is known as 
            a self-referenential relationship. Unfortunately, Castor does not 
            currently support self-referential relationships. An example of such 
            a relationship occurs when a <tt>Folder</tt> object contains a 
            reference to another <tt>Folder</tt> object. Castor does not 
            currently support this. However, there are ways around this 
            limitation. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            One way is to manage this type of relationship manually. For example, 
            let's say that a parent object <tt>FolderA</tt> needs to hold 
            references to child objects <tt>FolderB</tt>, <tt>FolderC</tt> and 
            <tt>FolderD</tt>. The <tt>Folder</tt> object contains not only a 
            property to hold its own id, but also a property to hold its parent 
            id (we'll call this <tt>parentId</tt>).  The <tt>parentId</tt> 
            property is used to determine if there is a relationship to another 
            <tt>Folder</tt> object. If <tt>parentId</tt> is null, there is no 
            relationship.  If <tt>parentId</tt> is populated, there is a 
            relationship and the object tree can be walked by comparing the 
            object id to the <tt>parentId</tt>. When the two properties are 
            equal, you're at the top of the tree. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Another say to solve this problem is to make use of an intermediary 
            object. For example, a <tt>Folder</tt> object contains a <tt>Reference</tt> 
            object in lieu of the actual <tt>Folder</tt> object. The <tt>Reference</tt> 
            object is somewhat of a proxy object whereby it only contains enough 
            information to identify the object to which the <tt>Reference</tt> 
            object refers. Then the <tt>Folder</tt> object can be easily 
            instantiated via the information contained in the <tt>Reference</tt>
            object. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Why do I get an ObjectModifiedException when trying to commit a transaction?">
            <p>
            The dirty checking engine will throw an <tt>ObjectModifiedException</tt> 
            when the values in the cache and in the database are different. This 
            can happen when someone else changed the database content, but also 
            when type mapping is not reversible.
            </p>

            <p>
            For example, if a java timestamp (<tt>java.util.Date</tt>) is stored as 
            a DATE, the time part is lost and the dirty checking will fail. Oracle 
            cannot tell the difference between an empty String and a null value: 
            if an attribute value is an empty String, dirty checking will also 
            fail. Some precision loss sometimes occur with floating point numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
            To avoid this, always use reversible mapping conversions. If this 
            is not possible, mark the fields with <tt>dirty="ignore"</tt> in 
            the mapping file.

            objects of one class and the cache size for this class is not enough. 
            You should either increase the size of the cache or change the cache type 
            to time-limited (the default cache type is count-limited, the default 
            size is 100), for example:
        <code><![CDATA[
<class ...>
  <cache-type type="count-limited" capacity="1000"/>
  ...
</class>
        ]]></code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Can I use the cache-type='none' with long transactions?">
            <p>
            As of release 0.9.5.3, you cannot. When using a cache of type 'none' with your 
            'Timestampable' objects, a MappingException is thrown when performing long 
            transactions. Currently, Castor requires a (performance) cache of type other than 
            'none' to be used with classes  that implement the 'TimeStampable' interface. In 
            other words, if you want to use long transactions, please make sure that you use 
            one of these cache types: 'unlimited', 'count-limited' or 'time-limited'. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The next entry has some more information about a potential cause of confusion in the 
            context of long transactions and a cache type other than 'unlimited'.

        <section title="What is causing a PersistenceException with long transactions and how do I fix it?">
            <p>
            With long transactions, sometimes update() throws a PersistenceException. As of 
            release 0.9.5.3, Castor requires a (performance) cache (of type other than 
            'none') to be used with classes that implement the 'TimeStampable' interface. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Please note that if you are using a cache type other than 'unlimited', 
            it is possible that objects expire from the cache. This case will be highlighted 
            to you by a PersistenceException being thrown.
            </p>
            <p>
            In this cases, please consider switching to cache type 'unlimited' (if possible) or 
            increase the size of the cache according to your needs when using 'count-limited'
            (which has a default capacity of 100).

    <section title="OQL">

        <section title="Is there any document available for Castor OQL?">

            <p>
            Yes. It is available from the Castor website: <a href="oql.html">Advanced JDO --> OQL</a>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="The OQL document describes several phases of development. Which is the current phase?">
            <p>
            We are currently working on Phase 3.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Does Castor OQL support sub-queries?">
            <p>
            Not yet
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="I cannot get Castor OQL to join two objects for me. Is it supported?">

            <p>
            Yes or no. Castor OQL supports implicit joins. And, in most case, 
            you simply don't need explicit join.
            </p>

            <p>
            Consider the following example, 
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT o FROM Order o, LineItem i WHERE o.id = i.id AND i.price > 100
            ]]></code>
            </p>
            <p>
            It is simply equivalent to the following OQL
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.lineItem.price > 100
            ]]></code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Can I write a pass-thru OQL?">
            <p>
            Yes. Just put "CALL SQL" keywords in front of your SQL statement. For example,
            <code><![CDATA[
OQLQuery oql = castorDb.getOQLQuery(
    "CALL SQL SELECT id, name, date "+
    "FROM user WHERE upper(name) like $1 AS myapp.Product");
            ]]></code>
            </p>
            <p>
            <b>
            But remember that the order of the fields listed must match what is 
            defined in the mapping file.
            </b>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Does Castor OQL support struct?">
            <p>
            No, Castor OQL doesn't support struct. For example, the following 
            query CANNOT be done:
            <code><![CDATA[
select c.name, c.age from Client c
            ]]></code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="How do I structure a query using the 'LIKE' expression?">
            <p>
            A query using the 'LIKE' expression includes the use of the SQL 
            wildcard '%'. The wildcard must be included in the <code>bind()</code> 
            statement:
            <code>
        OQLQuery oql = castorDb.getOQLQuery( "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.name LIKE $1" );
        oql.bind( "%widget%" );
            </code>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Does Castor support the SQL 'IN' expression?">
            <p>
            Yes. However, the full expression is a bit different using the LIST keyword. 
            The following example provides a demonstration:
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.id IN LIST ( 123, 456, 789 )
            ]]></code>
            </p>
            <p>
            If identifiers other than numbers are used, those identifiers must be 
            quoted:
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.name IN LIST ( "abc", "jkl", "xyz" )
            ]]></code>
            </p>
			<p>
            To include NULL values in the 'IN' list, use the 'nil' keyword:
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.name IN LIST( "ABC", nil )
            ]]></code>
            </p>
			<p>
            It is even possible to include bind values in the 'IN' lists using the following syntax:
            <code><![CDATA[
SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.id IN LIST( $(int)1, $2, $3 )
            ]]></code>

    <section title="Features requests">

        <section title="Can a foreign key be part of multiple primary keys?">
            <p>
            Unfortunately, the answer is no. We're aware that many users need 
            this feature so it is a very high priority in our todo list.
            </p>

            <p>
            If foreign key is the primary key, as a workaround you may consider 
            using the 'extends' relationship.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="Is polymorphic collection supported?">
            <p>
            Unfortunately, the answer is no.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            In version 0.8.11, we tried to enable polymorphic collection by 
            introducing the notation of Object Reloading. Object Reloading 
            delegates the determination of the class to a data object. However, 
            it is proved that reloading can only be done before any instance of 
            the target object is returned to user, and we have no way to determine 
            that. As a result, we removed the support in version 0.9.x.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            In the near future, we are going to use a new mechanism to provide 
            extends. The new mechanism loads a table with an SQL statement that 
            outer-joins all of the extending tables with the base. The existence 
            of an extended table row can be used to determine the class of a data 
            object. Notice that all extended table rows of the same entity should 
            always be stored in the same data-store.
            </p>

            <p>In the further future, we also want to let users to define a 
            discriminator column (or determinance field). Basing on the value of 
            discriminator columns in the base table, the bridge layer fetches the 
            additional information and returns the combined entity with the 
            appropriate list of entity classes.

     <section title="Data model issues">

        <section title="Is it possible to map an object to more than one tables?">
            <p>
            Yes, if the two tables share the same identity, you can specify one 
            data object to "extends" the other. When the extended data object is 
            loaded, its table (specified in <![CDATA[<map-to/>]]> will be joined 
            with all the tables of its super classes'.
            </p>

            <p>Another solution (in my opinion more flexible) is having two set 
            of methods in the main object. One for Castor JDO and another for 
            application.
            </p>

            <p>
            Consider the following example:
            <code><![CDATA[
class Employee {
   private int _employeeNumber;
   private Address _address;
   private Collection _workGroup;

   public int getEmployeeNumber() {
        return _employeeNumber;
   }
   public void setEmployeeNumber( int id ) {
        _employeeNumber = id;
   }

   // methods for Castor JDO
   public Address getAddress() {
       return _address;
   }
   public void setAddress( Address address ) {
        _address = address;
   }
   public Collection getWorkGroup() {
        return _workGroup;
   }
   public Collection setWorkGroup( Collection workGroup ) {
        _workGroup = workGroup;
   }

   // methods for application
   public String getAddressCity() {
       return _address.getCity();
   }
   public String getAddressZip() {
       return _address.getZip();

        </section>

        <section title="What is a dependent object?">
            <p>
            Dependent object is actually a concept from the object-oriented 
            database world.  A dependent object's lifetime depends on its master 
            object. So, create/delete/update of the master object will trigger 
            the proper actions, newly linked dependent object will be 
            automatically created and de-referenced dependent object will be 
            removed.
            </p>

            <p>
            The concept was also used in the earlier CMP 2.0 draft, although 
            it is later removed.

        <section title="How does Castor JDO work anyway?">
            <p>
            Let's use object loading as an example.
            </p>

            <p>
            When an application invoke db.load, the underneath <tt>TransactionContext</tt> 
            is invoked. If the object with the requested identity exists in the 
            <tt>TransactionContext</tt>, previously loaded object in the 
            <tt>TransactionContext</tt> is returned. Otherwise, <tt>TransactionContext</tt> 
            creates a new instance of the interested type and invokes LockEngine 
            to "fill" the object.
            </p>

            <p>
            <tt>LockEngine</tt> acquires a lock of the object, and it makes sure 
            <tt>ClassMolder</tt> has a thread-safe environment when it invokes 
            <tt>ClassMolder</tt>.  In <tt>ClassMolder</tt>, if the interested 
            set of fields representing the object is not existed in the cache 
            yet, <tt>SQLEngine</tt> will be invoked and the set of fields from 
            the underneath data store will be returned.  <tt>ClassMolder</tt> 
            binds the loaded or cached fields into the new instance. 
            <tt>ClassMolder</tt> requests the <tt>TransactionContext</tt> to 
            load the related and the dependent objects. Eventually, the object 
            is returned after all of the relationships are resolved.
            </p>

            <p>
            The process of commit has several states. The first state is 
            preStore. In preStore state, objects existing in the <tt>TransactionContext</tt> 
            are checked for modification one by one, including dependent and 
            related objects. De-referenced dependent objects are marked as 
            delete-able, and reachable dependent objects are added into 
            <tt>TransactionContext</tt>. An object is marked "dirty" if it is 
            modified. Also, if any modification should cause any related or 
            dependent to be dirty, the related or dependent object is marked as 
            dirty as well.
            </p>

            <p>
            After the preStore state, all dirty object is properly stored. And, 
            all marked delete object will be removed. Then, the connection is 
            committed. If succeed, all cache with be updated. Finally, all lock 
            is released.

        <section title="Does Castor support two-phase commits? How is this implemented?">
            <p>Yes, via <tt>javax.transaction.Synchronization</tt> interface.</p>
            
            <p>
            For Castor to work with global transactions, Castor must be configured
            to use global transaction demarcation in its main configuration file:
            </p>

            <code><![CDATA[

            <p>
            the <tt>Database</tt> implementation will authomatically be registered with 
            the transaction manager, as it implements <tt>javax.jta.Synchronization</tt>
            interface. Subsequently, the transaction manager communicates with Castor 
            via the beforeCompletion() and afterCompletion() calls.

    		<section title="Use of DATETIME fields in general">
    	
    			<p>MySQL in it's current releases (4.0.x and 4.1.x) does not store fractions of a 
    			   second in fields of type DATETIME that are mapped to java.sql.TimeStamp fields.
    			   As a result, Castor will throw ObjectModifiedExceptions during commits as Castor 
    			   internally maintains fractions of a seconds. </p> 
    			<p>Instead, Please use a column type that can be mapped to a long value, as Castor 
                   internally handles conversion between java.util.Date and long values with 
                   the required precision.</p>
    		</section>
    		
    		<section title="Use of TIMESTAMP fields &amp; NULLs in long transactions">
    		
    			<p>In MySQL, fields of type 'Timestamp' exhibit special behaviour wih regards to 
    			   NULLs. When inserting a "NULL" into such a field, it actually inserts the 
    			   current date and time. This causes problems for Castor's caching mechanism since 
    			   Castor internally believes the field is still NULL. If you subsequently perform 
    			   an update on the entry whilst it is still in the cache, an 
    			   ObjectModifiedException will be thrown, because Castor believes that the database 
    			   record has changed in the meantime.</p>

                <p>The workaround is to use a DATETIME field instead of TIMESTAMP.</p>

        <section title="How can I integrate Castor's logging with a logging infrastructure using Log4J?">
            <p>
            Please see <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/castor-dev@exolab.org/msg02710.html">
            this message</a> from the mailing list. It includes an adapter class

        </section>

		<section title="Can I see what SQL statement Castor issues to the database as a result of an operation?">
			
			<p>Yes, you can. By default, Castor uses JDBC proxy classes (wrapping
			   <tt>java.sql.Connection</tt> and <tt>java.sql.PreparedStatement</tt>) that capture the 
			   core SQL statements as generated by Castor and the user-supplied parameters at execution time
			   of the various persistence operations, and outputs them to the standard logger used
			   by Castor. By default, these output statements are not visible, as the log level is set 
			   to level 'info'. To see these SQL statements, please increase the log level to level 
			   'debug' in <tt>log4j.xml</tt>.</p>
			   
		</section>
	
		<section title="How can I disable the use of JDBC proxy classes?">
			
			<p>As of <b>release 0.9.7</b>, a new property<code>org.exolab.castor.persist.useProxies</code>
			   has been added to <tt>castor.properties</tt> to allow configuration of the JDBC proxy 
			   classes mentioned above. If enabled, JDBC proxy classes will be used for logging SQL 
			   statements. When turned off, no logging statements will be generated at all.</p>

   <section title="Lazy Loading related questions">
   
       <section title="How do I configure the JDO mapping to use the lazy loading feature for 1:1 relations?">

           <p>Let us convert one of the classes from the 
              <a href="http://castor.org/examples.html">JDO examples</a> to use 
              lazy-loading.</p>

           <p>In the example model, every Product belongs to one ProductGroup. This is 
              reflected in the conventional mapping as below. Here's the mapping for 
              Product:</p>

           <code><code-panel><![CDATA[
<!--  Mapping for Product  -->
<class name="myapp.Product"
       identity="id">
   <description>Product definition</description>
   <map-to table="prod" xml="product" />
   <field name="id" type="integer">
       <sql name="id" type="integer" />
       <xml name="id" node="attribute"/>
   </field>
 
   <!-- more fields ... -->

    <!--  Product has reference to ProductGroup,
          many products may reference same group  -->
    <field name="group" type="myapp.ProductGroup">
      <sql name="group_id" />
      <bind-xml name="group" node="element" />
    </field>
    
</class>
]]></code-panel></code>

           <p>Let us now make the relationship between Product and ProductGroup use 
              lazy loading. The relevant field in Product can be re-written like so:</p>

           <code>
               <code-panel>
    &lt;field name="group" type="myapp.ProductGroup" <b>lazy="true"</b>&gt;
      &lt;sql name="group_id" /&gt;
      &lt;bind-xml name="group" node="element" /&gt;
    &lt;/field&gt;
               </code-panel>
           </code>

           <p>There have been one change only. We have placed the attribute lazy="true" in 
              the field element. Note that no change is required in the ProductDetail 
              mapping.</p>

       </section>

       <section title="Lazy loading for 1:1 relations and serialization">
       
       	   <p>Please note that Castor does not support full serialization of lazy-loaded objects
       	      at this time. Rather than serializing just the information required to re-build the 
       	      underlying proxy implementation during deserialization, Castor will materialize (read: 
       	      load from the persistence store) all objects before serialization. As this can lead to 
       	      a lot of database accesses, please use this feature carefully. A full working 
       	      solution will be provided with the next release.</p>
       	      
       </section>
       
       <section title="How do I configure the JDO mapping to use the lazy loading feature for 1:m and M:N relations?">
           <p>
           Let us convert one of the classes from the <a href="http://castor.org/examples.html">
           JDO examples</a> to use lazy-loading.
           </p>

           <p>
           In the example model, one Product can contain many ProductDetails. This 
           is reflected in the conventional mapping as below. First, the mapping for 
           Product:
           <code><![CDATA[
<!--  Mapping for Product  -->
<class name="myapp.Product"
       identity="id">
   <description>Product definition</description>
   <map-to table="prod" xml="product" />
   <field name="id" type="integer">
       <sql name="id" type="integer" />
       <xml name="id" node="attribute"/>
   </field>
 
   <!-- more fields ... -->

   <!-- Product has reference to ProductDetail
            many details per product  -->
   <field name="details" type="myapp.ProductDetail" required="true"
           collection="vector">
       <sql many-key="prod_id"/>
       <xml name="detail" node="element" />
   </field>
</class>
            ]]></code>
            </p>
           <p>
           Now let us examine ProductDetail. Note, the relationship is mapped 
           <a href="#bi-directional">bi-directionally</a> as must be all relationships 
           when using Castor JDO.
           <code><![CDATA[
<!--  Mapping for Product Detail -->
<class name="myapp.ProductDetail" identity="id" depends="myapp.Product" >
   <description>Product detail</description>
    <map-to table="prod_detail" xml="detail" />
   <field name="id" type="integer">
       <sql name="id" type="integer"/>
       <xml node="attribute"/>
    </field>
    <field name="product" type="myapp.Product">
       <sql name="prod_id" />
       <xml name="product" node="element" />
    </field>
   
       <!-- more fields ... -->
   
</class>
           ]]>
           </code>
           </p>
           <p>
           Let us now make the relationship between Product and ProductDetail use 
           lazy loading. We need only change the way that the relationship to 
           ProductDetail is specified in the mapping of Product. The relevant field 
           in Product can be re-written like so: 
           <code><![CDATA[
<field name="details" type="myapp.ProductDetail" required="true" lazy="true"
            collection="collection">
   <sql many-key="prod_id"/>
   <xml name="detail" node="element" />
</field>
           ]]>
           </code>
           </p>
           <p>
           There have been two changes.
           <ul>
               <li>We have placed the attribute lazy="true" in the field element</li>
               <li>We have changed the type of the underlying collection type to be 
               a <tt>java.util.Collection</tt> by changing the field element attribute 
               to collection="collection".</li>
           </ul>   
           </p>
           <p> 
           Note that no change is required in the ProductDetail mapping.
           </p>
       </section>

       
       <section title="I have modified my mapping to use lazy loading. Now I 
       get the error 'no method to set value for field: com.xyz.ClassB in class: 
       ClassMolder com.xyz.ClassA' or 'org.exolab.castor.jdo.DataObjectAccessException: 
       no method to set value for field: com.xyz.ClassB in class: ClassMolder 
       com.xyz.ClassA'. What am I doing wrong?">
           <p>
           To use lazy loading you must also change the persistent class that 
           will hold the related objects. At the very highest level, you need 
           to provide a set method that accepts a java.util.Collection for the 
           field in question. This is demonstrated by changing the 
           <a href="http://castor.org/examples.html">JDO examples</a> below.
           </p>

           <p>
           In the original Product class we have the following code:
           <code><![CDATA[
import java.util.Vector;
...
private Vector       _details = new Vector();
...
public Vector getDetails()
{
   return _details;
}


public void addDetail( ProductDetail detail )
{
   _details.add( detail );
   detail.setProduct( this );
}
           ]]></code>
           </p>

           <p>
           Let us now make the necessary changes to set up lazy loading. As stated 
           above we now require a special set method for the related ProductDetails 
           (stored originally as a <tt>java.util.Vector</tt>) that accepts a 
           <tt>java.util.Collection</tt> as an argument. This mandates that we must 
           also use a <tt>java.util.Collection</tt> to hold our ProductDetails. If 
           this is not added, you will receive the errors above.
           <code><![CDATA[
import java.util.Collection;
...
private Collection       _details;
...
public Collection getDetails()
{
   return _details;
}


public void setDetails( Collection details )
{
   _details = details;
}

           ]]></code>

    <section title="Tuning for LOBs">
        <p>
        Castor JDO provides a property in <tt>castor.properties</tt> for adjusting 
        the size of the JDBC driver's buffer for reading LOBs (BLOBs and CLOBs) from 
        the database. The propery is named <tt>org.exolab.castor.jdo.lobBufferSize</tt> 
        and its default is 5120 bytes (5k). The size of this buffer can be tuned
        for larger LOBs, but is dependent upon the JDBC driver implementation being 
        used and what it supports.

    <section title="Database-specific issues">
    
        <section title="HSQL and identity key generators">
            <p>Due to a product limitation, AUTO_INCREMENT sequences in HSQL begin with 0 rather 1, 
               as is the case with most other RDBMS. As a result of this, long transactions will 
               not work for the object with the identity 0, and a ObjectModifiedException will be 
               thrown.</p>
               
            <p>To avoid this issue, we recommend inserting a temp object into the database in 
               question, and removing thereafter so that no object with identity 0 is stored.</p>

    <section title="Changing database configurations">

        <p>Some applications need to change the database connection or
           switch between different mapping files on the fly. Because Castor
           caches database configurations per name, you would have to register
           a new JDO configuration using a distinct name for any of the
           different configurations.</p> 

		<p>Instead you can call <api class="org.exolab.castor.jdo.engine.DatabaseRegistry">clear()</api> to 
		   reset the database registry before registering the new configuration as follows:</p>

		<code>
<comment>// Reset database registry</comment>
org.exolab.castor.jdo.engine.DatabaseRegistry.clear();
