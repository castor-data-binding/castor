      <p>
         Castor is an open source data binding framework for Java[tm].
         It's basically the shortest path between Java objects, XML documents and SQL tables.
         Castor provides Java to XML binding, Java to SQL persistence, and then
         some more.

    <section title="About the Castor Project">


      <p>The Castor project has been developed out of need: the need to get stuff done
         and the need to write useful code. It has been designed and coded over many cups
         of Dunkin Donut's Hazlenut coffee, Starbuck's Latte, and tall no-whip White Mochas,
         as proof that coffee beans do come in handy.</p>

      <p>For <a href="contributors.xml">a full list of contributors</a>.</p>
