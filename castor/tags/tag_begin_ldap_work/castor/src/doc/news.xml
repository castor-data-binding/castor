            <title>Castor 0.9.6 Release Candidates</title>

            <summary>
                I've placed a copy of the first Castor 0.9.6 release candidate on the
                <a href="ftp://ftp.exolab.org/pub/castor/castor_0.9.6/">FTP Server</a>.<br/><br/>

                This is mainly a bug fix release, but includes a couple of new features as 
                well. For details about the bugs fixed and features provided, please have 
                a look at (an interim version of) the 
                <a href="http://brainopolis.dnsalias.com/castorwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=ReleaseNotes096">release notes</a>.<br/><br/>
                
                The release candidate will be replaced by the official version within the 
                next three or four weeks, so please try this version and report any 
                regression issues (where applicable). A regression for this release is something 
                that was working in 0.9.5.4 but no longer is working in this 0.9.6 release 
                candidate. Only regression issues will be considered for fixing before the final
                0.9.6 release.<br/><br/>
                
                All other bugs will be moved out to 0.9.7, or a 0.9.6.x sub-release if necessary.

                I've placed a copy of the latest Castor 0.9.5.4 release candidate on the
                <a href="ftp://ftp.exolab.org/pub/castor/castor_0.9.5.4/">FTP Server</a>.

                This is a bug fix release, so please do not expect new features
                slated for 0.9.6 to appear in this release. The release candidate
                will be replaced by the official version by end of the week, so
                please try this version and report any regression issues. A
                regression for this release is something that was working in 0.9.5.3
                but no longer working in this 0.9.5.4 release candidate. Only
                regression issues will be considered for fixing before the final
                release. All other bugs will be moved out to 0.9.6, or a 0.9.5.5
                release if necessary.

               The Castor site now has a new
               <a href="http://castor.exolab.org/phpBB2">message board</a>.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Message boards are typically more user-friendly than mailing lists
               as they keeps the information in a much more organized fashion and don't
               add to our ever increasing inboxes.
               <br/>
               The mailing lists will continue to remain open and you can choose which
               ever communication method you prefer.

            Bruce Snyder is now authoring <a href="http://www.sourcebeat.com/TitleAction.do?id=8">Castor
            Live</a> for <a href="http://www.sourcebeat.com/">SourceBeat
            Publishing</a>. The first cut of the book will be out by the end
            of the July containing the first few chapters.
            <br />
            <br />
            The SourceBeat model is very different from traditional publishing because books
            are published online and <i>updated every month</i> by the author! Subscribers to
            a book receive a one year subscription and receive all updates to the title for that
            year. Also check out the <a href="http://jroller.org/page/CastorLive">Castor Live blog</a>
            for additional information.

                Please try this release and report any regression issues (preferably via Bugzilla).
                A regression is something that was working in a previous release (such as 0.9.5.2)
                but doesn't work in this release candidate. Please do not report issues that already
                have bug reports, but haven't been fixed yet in 0.9.5.3. These issues simply
                did not make the X.Y.Z release due to time constraints.
