    <section title="Introduction">
      <p>
        Castor XML is an XML databinding framework. Unlike the two main XML APIs,
        DOM (Document Object Model) and SAX (Simple API for XML) which deal with the
        structure of an XML document, Castor enables one to deal with the data defined
        in an XML document through an object model which represents that data.
      </p>
      <p>
         Castor XML can marshal almost any "bean-like" Java Object to and from XML.
         In most cases the marshalling framework uses a set of ClassDescriptors and FieldDescriptors
         to describe how an Object should be marshalled and unmarshalled from XML.
      </p>
      <p>
         For those not familiar with the terms "marshal" and "unmarshal", it's simply
         the act of converting a stream (sequence of bytes) of data to and from
         an Object. The act of "marshalling" consists of converting an Object to
         a stream, and "unmarshalling" from a stream to an Object.
      </p>

    <section title="The Marshalling Framework">
      <p>
         The marshalling framework, as it's name implies, is responsible for doing
         the conversion between Java and XML. The framework consists of two main classes,
         <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</api> and
         <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</api>.
      </p>

     <p>
        Lets walk through a very simple example. Assume we have a simple Person
        class as follows:
     </p>
        
		<code-panel>
import java.util.Date;

<comment>/** An simple person class */</comment>
public class Person implements java.io.Serializable {

   <comment>/** The name of the person */</comment>
   private String name = null;

   <comment>/** The Date of birth */</comment>
   private Date dob = null;

   <comment>/** Creates a Person with no name */</comment>
   public Person() {
      super();
   }

   <comment>/** Creates a Person with the given name */</comment>
   public Person(String name) {
      this.name  = name;
   }

   <comment>/**
     * @return date of birth of the person
     */</comment>
   public Date getDateOfBirth() {
      return dob;
   }

   <comment>/**
     * @return name of the person
     */</comment>
   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   <comment>/**
     * Sets the date of birth of the person
     * @param name the name of the person
     */</comment>
   public void setDateOfBirth(Date dob) {
      this.dob = dob;
   }

   <comment>/**
     * Sets the name of the person
     * @param name the name of the person
     */</comment>
   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }
}</code-panel>

         <p>
            To marshal an instance of the person class you simply call the Marshaller
            as follows:
         </p>

         <code-panel>
<comment>// Create a new Person</comment>
Person person = new Person("Ryan 'Mad Dog' Madden");
person.setDateOfBirth(new Date(1955, 8, 15));

<comment>// Create a File to marshal to</comment>
writer = new FileWriter("test.xml");

<comment>// Marshal the person object</comment>
Marshaller.marshal(person, writer);</code-panel>

         <p>
            To unmarshal an instance of the person class you simply call the Unmarshaller
            as follows:
         </p>

         <code-panel>
<comment>// Create a Reader to the file to unmarshal from</comment>
reader = new FileReader("test.xml");

<comment>// Marshal the person object</comment>
Person person = (Person) Unmarshaller.unmarshal(Person.class, reader);</code-panel>

         <p><b><i>Marshalling and Unmarshalling is basically that simple!</i></b></p>
         
		<p>
	       Note: The above example uses the <i>static</i> methods of the marshalling 
	       framework, and as such no Marshaller and/or Unmarshaller instances need to 
	       be created. A common mistake in this context when using a <b>mapping file</b> is 
	       to call the <tt>Marshaller</tt> or <tt>Unmarshaller</tt> as in the above 
	       example. This won't work, as the mapping will be ignored.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	       As such, if you are using a mapping file, use one of the <b>non-static</b> (un)marshal
	       methods on the <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</api> and
           <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</api> classes and call the Marshaller 
           or Unmarshaller as follows:
		</p>
		
         <code-panel>
<comment>// Load Mapping</comment>
Mapping mapping = new Mapping();
mapping.loadMapping("mapping.xml");

<comment>// Create a Reader to the file to unmarshal from</comment>
reader = new FileReader("test.xml");

<comment>// Create a new Unmarshaller</comment>
Unmarshaller unmarshaller = new Unmarshaller(Person.class);
unmarshaller.setMapping(mapping);
<comment>// Unmarshal the person object</comment>
Person person = (Person) unmarshaller.unmarshal(reader);</code-panel>

    <section title="Using XMLContext to bootstrap Castor">

		<p>
		   With Castor 1.1.2, the <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext">XMLContext</api> 
		   class has been added to the Castor marshalling framework. This new class provides a 
		   bootstrap mechanism for Castor XML, and allows easy (and efficient) instantiation of     
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller">Marshaller</api> and 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller">Unmarshaller</api> 
		   instances as needed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		   Above code sample for umarshalling a <tt>Person</tt> instance using an 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller">Unmarshaller</api> would 
		   change to:
		</p>
		
		<code-panel>
import org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext;
import org.exolab.castor.mapping.Mapping;
import org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller;
		
<comment>//create a Mapping instance</comment>
Mapping mapping = <b>XMLContext.createMapping()</b>;
mapping.loadMapping("mapping.xml");

<comment>// create an XMLContext instance and set mapping</comment>
XMLContext context = new XMLContext();
context.addMapping(mapping);

<comment>// create a new Unmarshaller</comment>
Unmarshaller unmarshaller = <b>context.createUnmarshaller()</b>;
unmarshaller.setClass(Person.class);

<comment>// Create a Reader to the file to unmarshal from</comment>
Reader reader = new FileReader("test.xml");

<comment>// Unmarshal the person object</comment>
Person person = (Person) unmarshaller.unmarshal(reader);</code-panel>
		   
		<p>
		   As shown above, the <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext">XMLContext</api> 
		   class offers various factory methods to obtain a new 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller">Marshaller</api>, 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller">Unmarshaller</api> or 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.mapping.Mapping">Mapping</api> instance.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		   When you need more than one <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller">Unmarshaller</api> 
		   instance in your application, please call 
		   <api class="org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext">createUnmarshaller</api> as required. As all 
		   <tt>Unmarshaller</tt> instances are created from the very same <tt>XMLContext</tt> 
		   instance, overhead will be minimal. Please note, though, that an 
		   <tt>Unmarshaller</tt> instance is not thread-safe.

    <section title="Using existing Classes/Objects">
      <p>
        Castor can marshal "almost" any arbitrary Object to and from XML. When descriptors
        are not available for a specfic Class, the marshalling framework uses reflection
        to gain information about the object.
        <body-note>
           Actually an in memory set of descriptors are created for the object
           and we will soon have a way for saving these descriptors as Java source,
           so that they may be modified and compiled with little effort.
        </body-note>
      </p>
      <p>If a set of descriptors exist for the classes, then Castor will use those
         to gain information about how to handle the marshalling.
         See <a href="#Class Descriptors">Class Descriptors</a> for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
         There is one main restrictions to marshalling objects. These classes must
         have have a public default constructor (ie. a constructor with no arguments)
         and adequete "getter" and "setter" methods to be properly be marshalled and unmarshalled.
      </p>
      <p>
         The example illustrated in the previous section
          <a href="#The Marshalling Framework">The Marshalling Framework</a>
         demonstrates how to use the framework with existing classes.
      </p>
   </section>

    <section title="Class Descriptors">
      <p>
         Class descriptors provide the "Castor Framework" with necessary information
         so that the Class can be marshalled properly.
         The class descriptors can be shared between the JDO and XML frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Class descriptors contain a set of
        <a href="#Field Descriptors">Field Descriptors</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        XML Class descriptors provide the marshalling framework with the information it
        needs about a class in order to be marshalled to and from XML.
        The XMLClassDescriptor <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLClassDescriptor</api>.
      </p>
      <p>
        XML Class Descriptors are created four main ways. Two of these are basically
        run-time, and the other two are compile time.
        <section title="Compile-Time Descriptors">
           <p>
              To use "compile-time" class descriptors, one can either implement the
              <api>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLClassDescriptor</api>
              interface for each class which needs to be "described", or have
              the <a href="sourcegen.xml">Source Code Generator</a>
              create the proper descriptors.
           </p>
           <p>
             The main advantage of compile-time descriptors is that they are
             faster than the run-time approach.
           </p>
        </section>
        <section title="Run-Time Descriptors">
           <p>
              To use "run-time" class descriptors, one can either simply let
              Castor introspect the classes, a mapping file can be provided,
              or a combination of both "default introspection" and a specified
              mapping file may be used.
           </p>
          <p>
             For "default introspection" to work the class being introspected must
             have adequete setter/getter methods for each field of the class
             that should be marshalled and unmarshalled. If no getter/setter
             methods exist, Castor can handle direct field access to public
             fields. It does not do both at the same time.
             So if the respective class has any getter/setter methods at all, then
             no direct field access will take place.
           </p>
           <p>
              There is nothing to do to enable "default introspection". If a
              descriptor cannot be found for a class, introspection occurs
              automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
              Some behavior of the introspector may be controlled by setting
              the appropriate properties in the <i>castor.properties</i> file.
              Such behavior consists of changing the naming conventions, and
              whether primitive types are treated as attributes or elements.
              See <i>castor.properties</i> file for more information.
          </p>
           <p>
              A mapping file may also be used to "describe" the classes which
              are to be marshalled. The mapping is loaded before any
              marshalling/unmarshalling takes place. See 
              <api>org.exolab.castor.mapping.Mapping</api>
          </p>
           <p>
             The main advantage of run-time descriptors is that it takes very
             little effort to get something working.
