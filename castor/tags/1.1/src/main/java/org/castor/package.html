    <p>New root package for all new classes added to Castor as of 
	   release 0.9.7. As discussed in 
	   <a href="http://castor.codehaus.org/license.html">the license help file</a>,
	   all new files added to the project and hence this package as of release 
	   0.9.7 (or refactored to a great extent) will carry a new Apache-style 
	   license.</p>
