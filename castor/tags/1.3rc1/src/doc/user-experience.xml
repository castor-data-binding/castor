                This document tries to communicate how the product (and its various parts)
                are used in the (professional) world. It presents you with useful information 
                in what context(s) Castor is being used, and as such provides you with a
                collection of reference points.

                    <b>Wireless MedCARE</b> is implementing a patient monitoring solution for 
                    nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.  A key part of 
                    our architecture is a Java application that receives data from various 
                    sensors then sends alerts and/or creates caregiver tasks based upon 
                    alarms and customer-specific business rules.  This application has a 
                    complex internal data model so we use Castor to marshal the data model 
                    to and from an XML configuration file. We also use Castor to marshal a 
                    facade layer to and from XML in order to implement an XML-RPC 
                    interface.  We use a manually-generated mapping file for configuration 
                    but automatically generate a mapping file from the facade objects.
