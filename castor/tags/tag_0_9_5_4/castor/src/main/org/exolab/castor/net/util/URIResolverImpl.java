     * <ul>
     *    <li><b>Absolute</b> URI: [scheme]:'//'[authority][absolute path]</li>
     *    <li><b>Relative</b> URI: '//'[authority][absolute path] or [relative path]

     *   <li>When [authority] is not used then '//' must not be used.</li>
     *   <li>An [absolute path] begins by a '/' sign.</li>
     * </ol>
     * For instance the following URIs are valid:

     *    <pre>
     *        file:/c:/Program Files/MyApp/myresource.xml
