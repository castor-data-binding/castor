                <p>We've placed a copy of Castor X.Y.Z release candidate N on the ftp site:
                <a href="ftp://ftp.exolab.org/pub/castor/castor_x.y.z/">ftp://ftp.exolab.org/pub/castor/castor_x.y.z/</a>.
                Please try this release and report any regression issues (preferably via Bugzilla).
                A regression is something that was working in a previous release (such as 0.9.5.2)
                but doesn't work in this release candidate. Please do not report issues that already
                have bug reports, but haven't been fixed yet in 0.9.5.3. These issues simply
                did not make the X.Y.Z release due to time constraints.
                </p>
