    <h2>Expressions And Results</h2>

    <p>An XPath expression is compiled using the XPath parser. To obtain a new parser instance
       use the static method {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathParser#newInstance newInstance}.
       Once obtained, the parser can be used to create XPath expressions using the {@link
       com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathParser#createExpression createExpression} method. Expressions
       are compiled and can be reused multiple times. The parser is thread-safe and can be
       used to create multiple expressions concurrently.</p>

    <p>{@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathExpression} is an abstract class representing an
       XPath expression. The primary method is {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathExpression#evaluate
       evaluate} that is used to evaluates the expression and returns the XPath result.</p>

    <p>An XPath result is represented by the abstract class {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathResult}.
       An XPath result can be one of the following four types:
       <ul>
         <li>A boolean result of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathResult#BOOLEAN} represented
              by an object of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.BooleanResult}.</li>
         <li>A string result of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathResult#STRING} represented
             by an object of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.StringResult}.</li>
         <li>A number result of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathResult#NUMBER} represented
             by an object of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.NumberResult}.</li>
         <li>A node-set result of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathResult#NODE_SET} represented
             by an object of type {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.NodeSet}.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>XPath Context</h2>

    <p>In order to evaluate an XPath expression, an XPath context is required. An XPath context
       provides a way to manage a stock of node-sets, resolve variable and function names, and
       return the size and position of the context. {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathContext}
       provides a base implementation of an XPath context. This implementation is not thread-safe,
       care must be taken not to use the same context when evaluating expressions concurrently.</p>

    <p>Impelementations may wish to extend this class and provide additional facilities
       for locating the document order of a node, or providing a function library.
       {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.Variables} provides variable bindings that can be used when
       evaluating an XPath expression, and {@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathFunction} can be used
       to implement extension functions.</p>


    <h2>XPath Node</h2>

    <p>{@link com.intalio.n3.xpath.XPathNode} is an abstract class representing a node in
       a document tree, on which XPath expressions can be evaluated. This abstract class provides
       all the services required by XPath, and enables multiple implementations to exist.
       It does not make use of iterators or traversals, but assumes double-linked lists are
       used to maintain node lists.</p>
