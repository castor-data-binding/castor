Adaptx (C) 1998-2003 Intalio, Inc, Keith Visco and XSL:P contributors


The following are changes from different versions of Adaptx


Version 0.9.4.8, March 04, 2003
-------------------------------

-- The sum() function now throws an exception if any node
   contained within the argument node-set contains a value
   which cannot be converted to a numeric value. The old
   behavior was simply to ignore non-numeric values.
   (kvisco - 2003-02-26)

-- Cleaned up exception handling in the ResultFormatter,
   ResultHandler and DefaultHandler code.
   (kvisco - 2003-02-25)



Version 0.9.4.7, January 27, 2003
---------------------------------

-- Fixed NullPointerException when parsing an XPath expression that is
   missing a closing parenthesis ')'.
   (kvisco, 2003-01-24)

-- Fixed Token#toString() to return "*" when Token is the Mulitply 
   Operator. This issue only affects apps that are using the 
   XPath Lexer directly.
   (kvisco, 2003-01-24)

Version 0.9.4.6, October 07, 2002
---------------------------------

-- Fixed issue with EqualityExpr not properly handling node-set
   arguments.
   (kvisco, 2002-09-19)

-- Fixed issue with StylesheetHandler incorrectly interpreting some
   literals as XSLT elements.
   (kvisco, 2002-09-19)

Version 0.9.4.5, May 31 2002
----------------------------

-- Fixed the XPNBuilder with respect to attribute namespaces. The 
   current element must be added to it's parent before namespace 
   resolution occurs for attributes, otherwise previously declared 
   namespaces in the parent context will not be available.
   (kvisco, 2002-05-30)


-- Added support for declaring namespace/prefix bindings for XPathContext.
   The only way to do it before was to extend XPathContext, provide the
   necessary logic for declaring namespaces and then override the 
   getNamespaceURI method.
   (kvisco, 2002-05-30)

-- Some improvements to loop detection. Sometimes a loop was incorrectly
   detected due to a for-each statment changing the current context node.
   This has now been fixed.
   (kvisco, 2002-05-29)

Version 0.9.4.4, March 27, 2002
-------------------------------

-- Changed the behavior of handling undefined extension functions.
   An exception is now thrown instead of simply reporting the error
   via a StringResult.
   (kvisco, 2002-03-25)

-- Changed the default behavior of XPathParser to throw an exception 
   upon parse errors instead of wrapping the exception in an ErrorExpr.
   This can be configured via a call to XPathParser#setUseErrorExpr.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-28)

-- Fix for descendants-or-self matching in PathExpr
   (kvisco, 2002-02-25)

-----------------------------------

-- Added support for Literal Result Element (LRE) Stylesheets.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-08)

-- Fix for issue with namespace resolution when XPathContext uses child contexts.
   This fixs bug #1901 (kvisco, 2002-02-08)

-- Implemented attribute-set merging for attribute sets with the same name.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-07)

-- Implemented use-attribute-sets on xsl:copy (kvisco, 2002-02-07)

-- Fixed built-in rules so that attributes values are copied through when no
   matching template is found. (kvisco, 2002-02-07)

-- Fixed a Path expression issue with matching a pattern with predicates.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-07)

-- Fixed bug with round function not properly handling NaN.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-06)

-- Fixed bug with substring function not properly handling the default length.
   (kvisco, 2002-02-06)

----------------------------------


-- Fixed bug with top-level variables (kvisco, 2002-02-05)

-- Added Text node normalization in default implementation of XPathNode 
   (kvisco, 2002-02-05)

-- Added support for ANT by providing an implementation of Ant's XSLTLiaison
   interface, (see org.exolab.adaptx.util.JakartaAntAdapter).
   (kvisco, 2002-02-04)

-- Fixed a bug with ancestor operator, path expressions with the ancestor 
   operator // were not always being matched properly due to misplaced {}
   in a conditional statement. (kvisco, 2002-02-05) 

-- Added XMLDiff for comparing XPathNode objects or XML files 
   (kvisco, 2002-01-30)

-- Fixed bug with namespace comparing in the getAttribute method of the
   default implementation of XPathNode.
   (kvisco, 2002-01-23)



Version 0.9.4,  December 11, 2001
---------------------------------

-- Fixed bug #1478 NodeSet as parameter to a named operators (mod, div, etc) 
   causes subsequent XPath expressions to break.
   (kvisco)



Version 0.9.3,  November 30, 2001
---------------------------------


-- Fixed bug with predicate expressions occuring before '/'. Reported by
   Anthony Desportes.
   (kvisco)
   
-- Fixed bug with operator names not being recognized if appearing after
   a function (eg: "position() mod 2")  This bug occured after a previous 
   fix was applied to make sure CNAMEs that clash with operator names were 
   not being marked as operators.
   (kvisco)

-- Fixed bug 1443 [StackOverFlow when variable name is not defined]
   (kvisco)

-- Fixes bug with less-than-or-equal-to "<=", was being treated as ">="
   instead. Reported by Thomas Yip.

    - changes a catch statement from catch(java.lang.Exception) to
      catch(java.lang.RuntimeException).
   (kvisco)

-- Upgraded to latest ANT, build.xml patch from Stefan Bodewig.
   (kvisco)


Version 0.9.2,  September 28, 2001
----------------------------------

-- Changed org.exolab.adaptx.xpath.VariableSet to be an abstract class. 
   This class now only has one abstract method #getVariable.
   (kvisco)

-- Created VariableSetImpl which is the default implementation of 
   VariableSet (actually it's basically the old version of VariableSet 
   with the addition of declaring that it extends VariableSet).
   (kvisco)


Version 0.9.1,  September 7, 2001 
--------------------------------

-- The VariableSet inner class is now marked as Serializable, which was preventing 
   VariableSet from being properly serializable.
   (Sebastien Sahuc)

----------------------------

-- Initial Release of Adaptx 0.9

-- Fix for != operator

-- added support for global variables that reference other global variables
   not yet declared.
-- fixed a bug with processing global variables.
   I am storing the global variable declarations in a hashtable.
   This could cause the variables to be processed out of order, since
   hashtables are not ordered. So if one variable referenced another one,
   before it was defined, the result was "undefined".
   I fixed this, by adding in the required support for out-of-order processing,
   which I had not yet implemented.

      to be fixed with IBM's 2.x version
      -- This causes the document order of attributes with the same name to be
         the same, and therefor causes improper document order sorting, and
         the same id was being generated for these nodes.
-- Added Michel Casabianca's additions to HTMLPrinter for more HTML elements
   that shouldn't print end elements

Build Number: 19990809
