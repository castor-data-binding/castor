/**
 * Implements a reference to an object that will be resolved at a later
 * time using some resolver mechanism. A resolvable reference can be
 * created in both resolved and unresolved states. Resolvable
 * references are immutable by definition.
 * <p>
 * A resolverable reference has two states: resolved and unresolved.
 * When in the resolved state, the reference will always return the
 * same resolved object. When in the unresolved state, the first time
 * the object is requested, it will be resolved and returned. At that
 * point the reference becomes resolved and the same object is returned
 * in subsequent requests.
 * <p>
 * The following example creates a resolved and unresolved objects
 * and then resolved the two:
 * <pre>
 * ResolvableReference resolved, unresolved;
 *
 * resolved = new ResolvableReference( myObject );
 * unresolved = new ResolvableReference( "id", resolver );
 * if ( resolved.get() == myObject )
 *   ; // This will always be true
 * if ( unresolved.get() == resolver.resolve( "id" ) )
 *   ; // This will always be true
 * </pre>
 * <p>
