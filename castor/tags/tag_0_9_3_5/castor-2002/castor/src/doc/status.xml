    <section title="Supported Features">

      <section title="Castor XML">
        <ul>
          <li>Automatic XML data binding for class definitions which adhere
              to the Java Beans design pattern.</li>

          <li>Java to XML mapping automates transformation of Java objects from
              and into XML documents and provides Java object validation</li>

          <li>An XML based mapping file to specify XML bindings.
          </li>

          <li>Source Code generator can produce Java class definitions,
              XML binding information and validation code based on
              a given XML schema.
          </li>

          <li>Supports W3C XML Schema October 24, 2000 Candidate Recommendation.
              For more information refer to the

      <section title="Castor JDO">
        <ul>
          <li>Java to SQL mapping (object/relational) automates Java persistence
              into any relational database server using JDBC</li>

          <li>Java to SQL mapping uses an XML document to specify the mapping
              textually, and provides an API to specify them programatically</li>

          <li>Supports one-one and one-many relation types, SQL/Java inheritance,
              object graph to single row mapping, and multiple column primary
              keys and automatic type conversion</li>

          <li>Optimistic and pessimistic locking modes, in-memory concurrency
              engine, and dead-lock detection</li>

          <li>Provides support for EJB 1.1 CMP entity beans (release 0.9)
              and CMP finder declaration using OQL</li>

          <li>Efficient implementation incurs little overhead compared to
              direct JDBC access</li>

          <li>Support for JTA transaction demarcation, inclusion as resource
              in transactional environment, and JDBC connection pooling
              (release 0.9 integrated with Tyrex)</li>

          <li>Cache control at JDO configuration and mapping file specification - no-cache option,
              cache object limit, cache time limit, LRU removal deamon</li>

          <li>New architecture separating the responsibility of the CacheEngine from
              that of the persistent object, in order to better support relations
              (especially many-many) and better handle dependency object commits.</li>

          <li>Multi column primary keys and contained objects.</li>

          <li>Mapping file supporting object dependency and relations. </li>

          <li>Serializable field type</li>
        </ul>

      <section title="Castor DSML">
        <ul>
          <li>Import/export an LDAP directory or search results to/from XML
              based on the industry standard DSML schema</li>

          <li>XML document for specifying LDAP queries and import rules</li>

          <li>Supports both JNDI service providers and the Mozilla Directory SDK</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="What's missing">
      <ul>
        <li>Work is under way on a direct SQL->XML bridge which uses the same
            mapping file but does not involve any Java objects in the process.</li>

        <li>The EJB CMP implementation is now developed in the scope of the
            OpenEJB project.</li>

        <li>Consolidation between the SQL and LDAP engine through a shared
            DataStore API, potentially supporting other relational back-ends.</li>

        <li>More generic mapping API and mapping tools.</li>

        <li>Stored procedures, BLOBs, XML content.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section title="TODO">
       <section title="JDO">
         <ul>
            <li>Add type convertors to bind parameters and load() method</li>

            <li>DataStore API replacing existing persist SPI. Consolidation of JDO and DAX.</li>

            <li>New mapping DTD</li>

            <li>Support for read-only fields</li>

            <li>SQLData, DOM and Castor XML data object field types</li>

            <li>Stored procedures</li>
         </ul>

          <section title="Source Code Generator">
            <ul>
               <li>Upgrade W3C XML Schema support to the March 16, 2001 Proposed
                   Recommendation.</li>
               <li>Support for element and object Containers (also called Wrappers)</li>
               <li>Create "customization" input file</li>

         <section title="Mapping">
            <p>
               Finish mapping/binding file support. Collection support in the mapping
               is currently limited on the XML side.
