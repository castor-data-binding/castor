    <title>Castor JDO Key Generator Support</title>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <p>The key generator gives a possibility to generate identity field
         values automatically. During <tt>create</tt> the value of the
         identity field is set to the value obtained from the key generator.
         Different algorithms may be used here, both generic and specific
         for database server.</p>

      <p>The key generator for the given class is set in the mapping
         specification file (<tt>mapping.xml</tt>), in the
         <tt>key-generator</tt> attribute of the <tt>class</tt> element,
         for example:
         <code><![CDATA[
  <class name="myapp.ProductGroup"
         identity="id" key-generator="MAX">
    <field name="id">
    </field>
  </class>]]>
         </code></p>
      <p>The following key generator names are supported in Castor 1.0:
         <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
           <tr><td>MAX</td><td>"MAX( pk ) + 1" generic algorithm</td></tr>
           <tr><td>HIGH-LOW</td><td>HIGH-LOW generic algorithm</td></tr>
           <tr><td>UUID</td><td>UUID generic algorithm</td></tr>
           <tr><td>IDENTITY</td><td>Supports autoincrement identity fields in
                                  Sybase ASE/ASA, MS SQL Server, MySQL and Hypersonic SQL</td></tr>
           <tr><td>SEQUENCE</td><td>Supports SEQUENCEs in Oracle, PostgreSQL, Interbase and SAP
DB</td></tr>
         </table></p>

      <p>Some of these algorithms have parameters, which can be specified 
         in the <tt>key-generator</tt> element of the mapping
         specification file, for example:
         <code><![CDATA[
  <key-generator name="HIGH-LOW">
    <param name="table" value="SEQ"/>
    <param name="key-column" value="SEQ_TableName"/>
    <param name="value-column" value="SEQ_MaxPKValue"/>
    <param name="grab-size" value="1000"/>
  </key-generator>

  <class name="myapp.ProductGroup"
         identity="id" key-generator="HIGH-LOW">
    <field name="id">
    </field>
  </class>]]>
         </code></p>

      <p>It is possible to create several key generators with the same
         algorithms but diffent parameters.
         In this case you have to specify the <tt>alias</tt> attribute
         in the <tt>key-generator</tt> element, for example:
         <code><![CDATA[
  <key-generator name="SEQUENCE" alias="A">
    <param name="sequence" value="a_seq"/>
  </key-generator>

  <key-generator name="SEQUENCE" alias="RETURNING">
    <param name="sequence" value="b_seq"/>
    <param name="returning" value="true"/>
  </key-generator>

  <class name="myapp.ProductGroup"
         identity="id" key-generator="RETURNING">
    <field name="id">
    </field>
  </class>]]>
         </code></p>
      <p>Below all supported key generators a described in details.</p>
    </section>

    <section title="MAX key generator">
      <p>MAX key generator fetches the maximum value of the primary key 
         and lock the record having this value until the end of transaction.
         Then the generated value is set to (MAX + 1).
         Due to the lock concurrent transactions which perform insert 
         to the same table using the same key generator algorithm will wait 
         until the end of the transaction and then will fetch new MAX value.
         Thus, duplicate key exception is almost impossible (see below).
         Note, that it is still possible to perform multiple inserts during
         the same transaction.</p>
      <p>There is one "singular" case of this algorithm: the case when
         the table is empty. 
         In this case there is nothing to lock, so duplicate key exception
         is possible.
         The generated value in this case is 1.</p>
      <p>This algorithm has no parameters.
         Primary key must have type <tt>integer</tt>, <tt>bigint</tt> or <tt>numeric</tt>.</p>
    </section>

    <section title="HIGH-LOW key generator">
      <p>This key generator uses one of the variants of the generic HIGH-LOW
         algorithm. It is needed a special auxiliary table ("sequence table")
         which has the unique column which contains table names (of the type
         <tt>char</tt> or <tt>varchar</tt>) and the column which is used to
         reserve values of the primary keys (of the type <tt>integer</tt>,
         <tt>bigint</tt> or <tt>numeric</tt>).
         The key generator seeks for the given table name, reads the last
         reserved value and increases it by some number N, which is called 
         "grab size". Then the lock on the auxiliary table is released,
         so that concurrent transactions can perform insert to the same table.
         The key generator generates the first value from the grabbed 
         interval.
         During the next (N - 1) invocations it generates the other grabbed
         values without database access, and then grabs the next portion.
         Note, that the auxiliary table must be in the same database as
         the table for which key is generated. So, if you work with multiple 
         databases, you must have one auxiliary table in each database.</p>
      <p>If the grab size is set to 1, the key generator each time stores
         the true maximum value of the primary key to the auxiliary table.
         In this case the HIGH-LOW key generator is basically equivalent to
         the MAX key generator.
         On you want to have LOW part of the key consisting of 3 decimal
         digits, set the grab size to 1000. If you want to have 2 LOW bytes in
         the key, set the grab size to 65536.
         When you increase the grab size, the speed of 
         key generation also increases because the average number of 
         SQL commands that are needed to generate one key is (2 / N).
         But that average number of key values that will be skipped (N / 2)
         also increases.</p>
      <p>The HIGH-LOW key generator has the following parameters:
         <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
           <tr><td>table</td><td>The name of the special sequence
table.</td><td>Mandatory</td></tr>
           <tr><td>key-column</td><td>The name of the column which contains
                   table names</td><td>Mandatory</td></tr>
           <tr><td>value-column</td><td>The name of the column which is used to
                   reserve primary key values</td><td>Mandatory</td></tr>
           <tr><td>grab-size</td><td>The number of new keys the key
                   generator should grab from the sequence table at a time.</td>
                   <td>Optional, default="10"</td></tr>
           <tr><td>same-connection</td><td>To use the same Connection for writing to the sequence
table, values:
                                "true"/"false". This is needed when working in EJB environment,
                                though less efficient.</td>
                   <td>Optional, default="false"</td></tr>
           <tr><td>global</td><td>To generate globally unique keys, values:
                                "true"/"false".</td>
                   <td>Optional, default="false"</td></tr>
         </table></p>
      <p>If the parameter "global" is set to "true", the sequence table contains only one row with
         <![CDATA["<GLOBAL>"]]> instead of the table name. This row serves for all tables.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to set same-connection="true" if you are working in EJB environment!</p>
      <p>Note, that the class HighLowKeyGenerator is not final, so you can
         extend it in order to implement other variants of HIGH-LOW
         algorithm (for example, HIGH/MID/LOW or char key values).</p>
    </section>

    <section title="UUID key generator">
      <p>This key generator generates global unique primary keys.
         The generated key is a combination of the IP address, the current
         time in milliseconds since 1970 and a static counter.
         The complete key consists of a 30 character fixed length string.</p>
      <p>This algorithm has no parameters.
         Primary key must have type <tt>char</tt>, <tt>varchar</tt> or
         <tt>longvarchar</tt>.</p>
    </section>

    <section title="IDENTITY key generator">
      <p>IDENTITY key generator can be used only with autoincrement primary
         key columns (identities) with Sybase ASE/ASA, MS SQL Server, MySQL and
         Hypersonic SQL.
         After the insert the key generator selects system variable
         <tt>@@identity</tt> which contains the last identity value for
         the current database connection.
         In the case of MySQL and Hypersonic SQL the system functions
         <tt>LAST_INSERT_ID()</tt> and <tt>IDENTITY()</tt> are called, respectively.
         </p>
      <p>This algorithm has no parameters.</p>
    </section>

    <section title="SEQUENCE key generator">
      <p>SEQUENCE key generator can be used only with Oracle, PostgreSQL,
         Interbase and SAP DB.
         It generates keys using sequences.</p>
      <p>The key generator has the following parameters:
         <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
           <tr><td>sequence</td><td>The name of the sequence</td>
                                <td>Optional, default="{0}_seq"</td></tr>
           <tr><td>returning</td><td>RETURNING mode for Oracle8i, values:
                                "true"/"false"</td>
                                <td>Optional, default="false"</td></tr>
           <tr><td>increment</td><td>Increment for Interbase</td>
                                <td>Optional, default="1"</td></tr>
           <tr><td>trigger</td><td>Assume that there is a trigger that already 
                                   generates key. Values: "true"/"false"</td>
                                <td>Optional, default="false"</td></tr>
         </table></p>
      <p>Usually one sequence is used for one table, so in general you have to
         define one key generator per table.
         But if you use some naming pattern for sequences, you can use one 
         key generator for all tables.
         For example, if you always obtain sequence name by adding "_seq" to
         the name of the correspondent table, you can set "sequence" parameter
         of the key generator to "{0}_seq" (the default value).
         In this case the key generator will use sequence "a_seq" for table 
         "a", "b_seq" for table "b", etc.  Castor also allows for inserting 
         the primary key into the sequence name as well.  This is accomplished 
         by including the {1} tag into the "sequence" parameter. Example: 
         "{0}_{1}_seq"</p>
      <p>Actually the SEQUENCE key generator is "4 in 1". 
         With PostgreSQL it performs "SELECT nextval(sequenceName)" before 
         INSERT and produces identity value that is then used in INSERT.
         Similarly, with Interbase it performs
         "select gen_id(sequenceName, increment) from rdb$database" before
         INSERT.
         With Oracle by default (returning=false) and with SAP DB it transforms
         the Castor-generated INSERT statement into the form
         "INSERT INTO tableName (pkName,...) VALUES 
         (sequenceName.nextval,...)" and after INSERT it performs "SELECT 
         seqName.currval FROM tableName" to obtain the identity value. With 
         Oracle8i it is possible to use more efficient RETURNING mode: to 
         the above INSERT statement is appened "RETURNING primKeyName INTO 
         ?" and the identity value is fetched by Castor during INSERT, so 
         that only one SQL query is needed.</p>
      <p>In case when your table has an on_Insert trigger which already generates
         values for your key, like the following Oracle example: 
         <code>
   create or replace trigger "trigger_name"
   before insert on "table_name" for each row 
   begin 
      select "seq_name".nextval into :new."pk_name" from dual;
   end;
          </code>
          you may set the "trigger" parameter to "true". This will prevent the 
          "Sequence_name".nexval from being pulled twice (first time in the insert 
          statement (see above), then in the trigger). Also usefull in combination 
          with the "returning" parameter set to "true" for Oracle (in this case you 
          may not specify the sequence name).
