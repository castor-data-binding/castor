            <p>
               Castor does not currently support introspection of private
               methods. Please make sure proper public accesssor methods
               are available for all fields that you wish to be handled
               by the Marshalling Framework.

            <p>
               Make sure you are not using one of the <i>static</i> methods
               on the Marshaller/Unmarshaller. Any configuration changes
               that you make to the Marshaller or Unmarshaller are not
               available from the static methods.

            <section title="Can I use a DTD with the source generator?">
            <p>
                  Not directly, however you can convert your DTD to an XML Schema
                  fairly easily. We provide a tool (org.exolab.castor.xml.dtd.Converter)
                  to do this. You can also use any number of 3rd-party tools such as
                  XML Spy or XML Authority.

            <section title="My XML output looks incorrect, what could be wrong?">
            <p>
               Are the generated class descriptors compiled? Make sure they
               get compiled along with the source code for the object model.
