    <section title="Guidelines">
    <p>
The following are some general "common-sense" guidelines for using the
mailing lists:</p>

<p><pre>
Most people are already following these guidelines. To those people, I
thank you. For those of you who are not...please read carefully.

1. Please refrain from using words and phrases like URGENT, IMPORTANT,
   MY WIFE WILL LEAVE ME IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND, etc, in the subject line
   of your postings. Or even in the body of the message for that matter.

   You may think that things which are URGENT, or IMPORTANT to you,
   are just as urgent and important to everyone else reading this
   list. You'd be surprised at just how wrong an assumption like
   that can be. As a matter of fact, I personally tend to read
   all such postings last and give them a low priority.

2. Please use meaningful subject lines. "Newbie Question",
   is not meaningful what-so-ever.

3. Please provide necessary information, where applicable.
   Statements like, "I recieve a NullPointerException when
   using Castor, what's up with that?", are not very helpful,
   add unnecessary traffic on the list, and will probably
   never get an answer.

4. As a follow on to #3, when submitting examples, please try
   to submit the smallest possible example which demonstrates
   the problem. Short examples are easier to follow and will
   get quicker responses from developers or other users than
   long examples with lots of extraneous code/data.

4. Please read the documentation before posting. One of the
   biggest problems is that there is not a lot of documentation
   to Castor. At the same time, because it doesn't take long,
   everyone should read what is written before posting.

5. Please check the mail archives before posting. Many questions
   on this list have already been answered before. I am aware
   that the current mail archive is not very good on a number
   of issues (searching, reliability, etc). We are working
   on these issues and hope to have a new archive system in
   place shortly.
