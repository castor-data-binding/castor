    <section title="About the Castor Project">

      <p>The Castor project has been developed out of need: the need to get stuff done
         and the need to write useful code. It has been designed and coded over many cups
         of Dunkin Donut's Hazlenut coffee, Starbuck's Latte, and tall no-whip White Mochas,
         as proof that coffee beans do come in handy.</p>

      <p>The Castor Project was started and originally developed by

         <a href="mailto:arkin@remove-no-spam.intalio.com">Assaf Arkin</a> of Intalio, Inc.
