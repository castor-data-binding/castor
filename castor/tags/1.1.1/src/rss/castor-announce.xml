                  This is a short message for those who have created Jira issues
                  in the past two or three months or so, or have commented upon
                  existing issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It looks like during some Jira upgrade a few months ago, a
                  couple of Jira settings got disabled. As a result, the
                  original reporter of a Jira issue did not get notified about
                  any changes to the issue (incl. e.g. state changes, comments,
                  questions, etc.)...

                As you might (not) have noticed, all the project-related
                infrastructure (mailing lists, SVN repository, HTML docs,
                binaries etc.) has been off-line due to a hard disk failure on
                one of the Codehaus servers. As a result of a lot of dedication
                from the Codehaus folks, we are as of now in a position to
                re-start life as usual.

                <p>
                   we are proud to participate in the Summer of Code initiative
                  (http://code.google.com/soc/) sponsored by Google, and you are
                  invited to join in the fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At http://docs.codehaus.org/display/CASTOR/CastorSocProjects,
                  you'll find some suggestions we find suitable for the program,
                  and per definition we would be glad to support a few projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please understand, though, that mentoring capacities will be
                  limited, though we will try to dedicate as much time as
                  possible to the suggested projects. That implies that we
                  depend on your dedication during the preparation of the
                  detailed specification and description of the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The timeframe for applications is May 1 - May 8. So have a
                  look at the projects offered before you sign up to the program
                  and apply as a student to be mentored by us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On April 14, 2006 we migrated the Castor source repository
                  from CVS to SVN. At the moment we still have read-only access
                  to CVS, but CVS does not reflect commits to SVN after the
                  migration. The read-only access to CVS is intended for you to
                  create patches of your current work and move it over to SVN.
                  Be aware that we will switch off CVS soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For details about SVN access please have a look at:

                roadmap at
                http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel
                As it stands right now, this will reveal that we have scheduled
                two releases (0.9.7 and 0.9.9) within the next 5 weeks, the
                former designated to be a maintenance release for Castor 0.9.6,
                the latter planned as a feature release with quite some new
                features and improvements to be added.

            <description><![CDATA[
                One of the major short-comings of Castor JDO always has been
                missing support for polymorphism. As of last week, most of the
                work has been finished, and we are now in a position where we'd
                like to ask you, our users, for feedback. I've made available
                binaries at
                http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/previews/0.9.6_with_polymorphism/.
                Please use the source distribution if possible, as it contains
                the tests mentioned above as well.

                This is to announce that we finally moved our mailing lists to
                the Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org). For a period of 14 days
                we'll monitor the old lists at Exolab, mainly referring you to
                the lists mentioned above. After this period, we will turn off
                these lists at our discretion. For details, please see
                http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html.

                <p>
                  After over five years of Exolab (http://www.exolab.org)
                  sponsoring Castor, the Castor team recently decided to move
                  the entire project to a new home over at the Codehaus
                  (http://www.codehaus.org). The team would like to thank Exolab
                  and its parent company Intalio, Inc. for its long-standing
                  support of the project.
                </p>
