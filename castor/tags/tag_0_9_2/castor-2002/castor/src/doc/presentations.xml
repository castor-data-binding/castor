         <p/>
         Andrew Fawcett, of CODA, gave a presentation on XML data binding
         with Castor at the XML One conference in London, March 2001.
         Andrew has sent us his presentation and we will make this available soon.

         <b>O'Reilly Java Conference (March 2000)</b>
         <p/>
         The first public presentation on Castor was done at the O'Reilly Java Conference
         in March 2000. It's a little dated, but still serves as a decent overview
         of what Castor is all about.
