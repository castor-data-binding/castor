        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>
            <application>Castor JDO</application> uses the 
            <application>Jakarta Common's Logging</application> package for output 
            information relevant to the execution of a specific JDO operations to a 
            log file. The information output historically included the SQL statements 
            used by <application>Castor</application> to execute the various 
            persistence operations such as loading or updating domain entities. 
            Unfortunately, the SQL statements logged did not include any information 
            about the parameters being bound to the prepared statements immediately 
            before execution, and hence made it very hard for users of 
            <application>Castor JDO</application> to analyze these in the case of an 
            issue/problem.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            To improve this situation, proxy classes for the 
            <interface>java.sql.Connection</interface> and 
            <interface>java.sql.PreparedStatement</interface> interfaces have been 
            added, to allow for complete and better JDBC statements to be output to 
            the log files. As this might impose a performance penalty at run-time, 
            we have allowed for this to be turned off completely through the standard 
            Castor property file. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
            A new property has been added to the Castor property file 
            (<filename>castor.properties</filename>) to allow configuration of this 
            feature.

        <title>Intended Audience</title>

        <para>
            Anyone who wants to use the new JDBC proxy classes with 
            <application>Castor JDO</application> selectively, i.e. enabling and 
            disabling their use.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The example given describes how to turn the use of the proxy classes on/off.

        <para>
            You should have a valid <filename>castor.properties</filename> file as 
            part of your application.

            <title>Enable the use of the JDBC proxy classes</title>

            <para>
                To enable the use of the JDBC proxy classes described above, please 
                add the following section to your 
                <filename>castor.properties</filename> file.
            </para>

            <programlisting>
            
  # True if JDBC proxy classes should be used to enable more detailed logging output of SQL
  # statements; false otherwise (logging of SQL statements will be turned off completely).
  #
  org.exolab.castor.persist.useProxy=true
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                This instructs <application>Castor JDO</application> to use the JDBC 
                proxy classes and to output full information about the SQL statements 
                used at run-time. When disabled, no logging of SQL statements will 
                occur at all.
