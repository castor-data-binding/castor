      <title>The JDO Model</title>

        <para>
           In order to understand how the JDO transaction model affects applications
           performance and transactional integrity, you must first understand the semantics
           of the Java Data Objects. Java Data Objects are objects loaded from and stored
           to the database, but are disassociated from the database itself. That is, once an
           object has been loaded into memory, changes to the object in memory are not
           reflect in the database until the transaction commits.
        </para>

        <para>
           The following table shows a sample code and the state of the JDO object and
           the relevant database field:

         <para>
             Concurrency conflicts do not occur when an object is changed in memory,
             but rather when the transaction commits and changes are saved back to the
             database. No changes are saved if the transaction rolls back.
         </para>

         <para>
             Conflicts could occur if two threads attempted to modify the same object,
             or the same thread receives two objects associated with the same database 
             record and performs different changes to each object. Castor solves these 
             issues through a transaction-object-identity association.
         </para>

         <para>
             When the same transaction attempts to query the same database record twice,
             (e.g. as the result of two different queries) the same object is returned,
             assuring that different changes will be synchronized through the same 
             object.
         </para>

         <para>
             When two transactions attempt to query the same database record, each 
             transaction receives a different object mapping to the same record, 
             assuring that changes done in one transaction are not visible to the 
             other transactions. Changes should only become visible when the 
             transaction commits and all its changes are made durable.
         </para>

         <para>
             This approach places the responsibility of synchronization and deadlock 
             detection on the Castor persistence engine, easing the life of the 
             developer.
         </para>
    </section>

    <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.modes">
      <title>Locking Modes</title>

      <para>
          Concurrent access requires use of locking to synchronize two transactions
          attempting to work with the same object. The locking mechanism has to take into
          account several possible use of objects, as well as help minimize database access
          through caching and is-modified checking.
      </para>

      <para>
          Locking modes are declared in the <link linkend="jdo.mapping.file.class-element">
          class element</link> of the XML mapping on a per class basis.
      </para>

      <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.modes.shared">
        <title>Access mode: Shared</title>

        <para>
           The shared mode is the default for all objects, unless otherwise specified in the
           mapping file. Shared mode allows two transactions to read the same record at the
           same time. Each transaction will get it's own view of the record as a separate
           object, to prevent in-memory changes from conflicting with each other. However,
           the values loaded from the database are the same for both transactions.
        </para>

        <para>
           When transactions query different objects or query the same objects but for
           read-only purposes, shared access provides the most efficient means of access
           in terms of performance, utilizing record caching and eliminating lock
           contention. For example, when each transaction retrieves a different Customer
           record and all transactions retrieved the same set of Department records but
           hardly ever change them, both Customer and Department should be declared as
           having a shared lock.
        </para>

        <para>
           However, when two transactions attempt to access the same object, modify it,
           and commit the changes, a concurrency conflict will occur. Some concurrency
           conflicts can lead to one of the transactions aborting. For example, if two
           transactions happen to load the same Account object with a balance of X,
           one adds 50 and the other adds 60, if both were allowed to commit the changes
           the new account balance will be either X+50 or X+60, but not X+110.
        </para>

        <para>
           In the above case either exclusive or db-locked modes should be used to
           reduce potential conflicts. However exclusive and db-locked modes may cause
           the application to perform slower due to lock contention and should not be
           used as the general case. In rare cases conflicts may occur where shared
           locks are the preferred choice, e.g. when two transactions attempt to
           modify the same Department object, or somehow get hold of the same Customer
           records.
        </para>

        <para>
           Castor detects such conflicts as they occur and uses two mechanisms to
           deal with them: write locks and deadlock detection. When a transaction commits
           Castor first tries to determine whether the object has been modified from
           it's known state (i.e. during query). If the object has not been modified,
           Castor will not attempt to store the object to the database. If the object 
           has been modified, Castor acquires a write lock on the object preventing 
           other transactions from accessing the object until the current transaction 
           completes storing all changes to the database. A write lock prevents other 
           transactions from acquiring either a write or read lock, preventing them 
           from accidentally loading a dirty image of the object.
        </para>

        <para>
           If the second transaction has a read lock on the object, the current
           transaction will block until the second transaction releases the lock,
           either by rolling back or by not modifying its object. If the other
           transaction modifies the object and attempts to store it, a deadlock
           occurs. If both transactions have a read lock, both require a write lock in
           order to proceed and neither can proceed until the other terminates.
        </para>

        <para>
           Castor detects such deadlock occurences and causes the second transaction
           to rollback, allowing the first transaction to commit properly. Such
           conflicts do not happen often, but when they happen some transactions will
           fail. The application developer should either be aware of the possibility
           of failing, or choose to use a more severe lock type.
        </para>

        <para>
           Conflicts occur not just from other Castor transactions, but also from
           direct database access. Consider another application modifying the exact
           same record through direct JDBC access, or a remote server connecting to
           the same database. To detect such conflicts Castor uses a dirty checking
           mechanism.
        </para>

        <para>
           When an object is about to be stored, Castor compares the current values
           in the database records with those known when the object was originally
           loaded from the database. Any changes are regarded as dirty fields and
           cause the transaction to rollback with the proper error message.
        </para>

        <para>
           Not all fields are necessarily sensitive to dirty checking. The balance
           in a bank account is a sensitive field, but the date of the last transaction
           might not be. Since the date does not depend on the original value of the
           account, but on the last modification to it, dirty checking can be avoided.
        </para>

        <para>
           A field marked with dirty="ignore" <!--(in the <a href="jdo-mapping.html#The-<sql>-element">
           &lt;sql> element</a> of the mapping descriptor)-->will not take part in dirty 
           checking. Furthermore, modifications to such a field will not require a 
           write lock on the object, further improving throughput. Marking fields as 
           non-dirty should be done with extreme care.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.modes.exclusive">
        <title>Access mode: Exclusive</title>

        <para>
           The exclusive mode assures that no two transactions can use the same
           record at the same time. Exclusive mode works by acquiring a write lock in
           memory and synchronizing transactions through a lock mechanism with configured
           timeout.
        </para>

        <para>
           Using in-memory locks, exclusive access provides some transaction synchronization
           that is efficient in terms of performance and increases the chance of a commit
           being successful. It does not, however, guarantee commit. Since the lock is
           acquired by Castor, it can be used to synchronize Castor access, but other forms
           of direct database access may still modify the database record.
        </para>

        <para>
           When a transaction obtains an object that was specified as exclusive access
           in the mapping file or when performing a query, Castor will always obtain a
           write lock on that object. The write lock will prevent a second transaction
           from being able to access the object either for read or write, until the current
           transaction commits. If the object is already being accessed by another
           transaction, the current transaction will block until the other transaction
           commits and release the lock.
        </para>

        <para>
           It is possible to upgrade from a shared to an exclusive lock by calling the
           <methodname>org.exolab.castor.jdo.Database.lock(java.lang.Object)</methodname>
           method. This method can be used with shared objects when the application
           wants to assure that other transactions will be blocked and changes can be
           made to the current object.
        </para>

        <para>
           Because direct database access can modify the same record as represented by
           an exclusive locked object, Castor uses dirty checking when updating the
           database. Dirty checking does not have a severe affect on performance, and can
           be disabled by marking all the fields of the object with dirty="ignore".
        </para>

        <para>
           To reduce the possibility of dirty reads, Castor will always synchronize
           exclusive locked objects with the database at the beginning of a transaction.
           That is, when an object is loaded the first time in a transaction with an
           exclusive lock, Castor will retrieve a fresh copy of the object from the
           database. Castor will not, however, refresh the object if the lock is upgraded
           in the middle of a transaction using the <methodname>lock</methodname> method.
        </para>

        <para>
           Exclusive mode does cause lock contention and can have an affect on application
           performance when multiple transactions attempt to access the same record.
           However, when used smartly with on a small set of objects it can help reduce
           the possibility of concurrency conflicts. It can also be used to force an object
           to be loaded from the database and the cache refreshed.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.modes.database-locked">
        <title>Access mode: Database Locked</title>

        <para>
           The locked mode performs optimistic locking using the underlying database
           engine to assure that only one transaction has access to the record.
           In addition to acquiring a write lock in memory, Castor performs a query
           with a special SQL construct (FOR UPDATE in Oracle, HOLDLOCK in Sybase)
           to guarantee access by one transaction.
        </para>

        <para>
           In the event that the same database record will be accessed directly through
           JDBC, stored procedure, or a second machine using Castor, the only way to
           achieve object locking is through the database layer. However, such write
           locks should be cooperative, that is, other forms of database access should
           attempt to use the same locking mechanism.
        </para>

        <para>
           In some isolation levels, when Castor acquires a write lock on the database
           it will prevent other applications from accessing the same record until the
           Castor transaction commits. However, certain isolation levels allow other 
           applications to obtain a dirty image of the record.
        </para>

        <para>
           Write locks on the database have a severe impact on application performance.
           They incur overhead in the database manager, and increase lock contention.
           It is recommended to use database locks with care, pay extra attention to the
           isolation level being used, and follow good practices recommended by the
           database vendor with regards to such locks.
        </para>

        <para>
           In the future long transaction will be supported. Long transactions rely on
           the dirty checking mechanism and only hold connections open for as long as
           they are required for queries. Long transactions cannot be used with database
           locking.
        </para>

        <para>
           Locked mode must be specified for the object in the mapping file or when
           conducting the query. It is not possible to upgrade to a locked lock in the
           middle of a transaction.
        </para>

        <para>
           Objects loaded in this mode are always synchronized with the database, that
           is, they will never be obtained from the cache and always re-loaded for each
           new transaction.

      <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.modes.read-only-queries">
        <title>Read-only Queries</title>

        <para>
           When a query is performed in read-only mode or no mode is specified and the
           object is marked as read-only in the database, Castor will return a transient
           object. The returned object will not be locked and will not participate in the
           transaction commit/rollback.
        </para>

        <para>
           When the same object is queried twice in a transaction as read-only, Castor
           will return two separate objects, allowing the caller to modify one object
           without altering the other. Castor will utilize the cache and only perform
           one load from the database to the cache.
        </para>

        <para>
           Read-only access is recommended only when the object is intentionally queried
           as read-only and changes to the object should not be reflected in the database.
           If the object will not be modified, or modifications will be stored in the
           database, it is recommended to use the shared mode. Shared mode allows the
           same object to be returned twice in the same transaction.

    <section id="advanced-jdo.locking.visibility-of-changes">
        <title>Visibility of Changes</title>

        <para>
            The visibility of changes occuring in one transaction to other transactions
            depends upon the transaction isolation level specified for the database connection.
            Whether or not the changes are visible in the current transaction depends upon the
