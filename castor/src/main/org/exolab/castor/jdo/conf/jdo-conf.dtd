<!--
    The database configuration specifies the means to obtain a connection
    to the database server, the mapping between Java classes and tables
    in that database server, and the service provider to use for talking
    to that server.

    The application will access the database by its given name (name)
    and will be able to persist all objects specified  in the included
    mapping file(s).

    The means to acquire a database connection is specified in one of
    three ways: as a JDBC 2.0 driver and URL, as a JDBC 2.0 DataSource,
    or as a DataSource to lookup through JNDI. When Castor is used inside
    a J2EE application server it is recommended to use the JNDI lookup,
    allowing the application server to manage connection pooling and
    distributed transaction.

    The class mapping is included from an external mapping file,
    allowing multiple mappings to be included in the same database
    configuration, as well as two database to share the same mappings.

    For concurrency and integrity reasons, two database definitions
    should never attempt to use overlapping mappings. It is recommended
    to use one database configuration per database server.

    The engine attribute specifies the persistence engine for this database
    server. Different  database servers vary in the SQL syntax and capabilites
    they support, and this attribute names the service provider to use.

    The following names are supported in Castor 1.0:

    generic     Generic JDBC engine
    oracle      Oracle 7 and Oracle 8
    sybase      Sybase 11 and SQL Anywhere
    sql-server  Microsoft SQL Server
    postgresql  PostgreSQL 6.5 and 7

    Includes class mapping from the specified mapping file.

    The href attribute may be an absolute URL (typically a file: URL)
    or a name relative to the base URL of the database configuration
    file (typically in the same path).

    Relative URLs also work if the database configuration and mapping
    files are obtained from the application JAR or classpath.

<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 driver for obtaining new connections to
    the database server. The driver is obtained from the JDBC
    DriverManager and must be located in the class path.

    The JDBC URL locates the driver and provides the access properties.
    Additional properties may be specified using the param element
    (e.g. buffer size, network protocol, etc).

    Use the class-name attribute to specify the driver class for
    automatic registration with the JDBC DriverManager. If missing,
    the driver must be registered in any other means, including
    properties file, Class.forName(), etc.

    For example, to configure an Oracle 8 thin driver, use:

    <driver class-name="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
            url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@machine:port:SID">
      <param name="user" value="scott" />
      <param name="password" value="tiger" />
    </driver>

    When running Castor inside a J2EE application server, it is
    recommended to use jndi.

<!ELEMENT param EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST param
          name  CDATA #REQUIRED
          value CDATA #REQUIRED>


<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 DataSource for obtaining new connections
    to the database server. DataSources are defined in the JDBC 2.0
    standard extension API which is included with Castor, and implement
    the interface javax.sql.DataSource.

    The DataSource implementation class name is specified in the
    class-name attribute and configured through Bean-like accessor
    methods specified in the param element.

    The DTD for the param element is undefined and depends on the
    DataSource being used.

    For example, to configure a PostgreSQL 7.0 DataSource, use:

    <data-source class-name="org.postgresql.PostgresqlDataSource">
      <param host="host" database="db"
             user="user" password="secret" />
    </data-source>

    When running Castor inside a J2EE application server, it is
    recommended to use jndi.

<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 DataSource for obtaining new connections
    to the database server through JNDI lookup. The JNDI environment
    naming context is used to obtain a suitable DataSource.

    When running inside a J2EE application server, this is the
    preferred method for obtaining database connections. It enables
    the J2EE application server to configure the connection, maintain
    a connection pool, and manage distributed transactions.

    For example, to specify a J2EE DataSource, use:

      <jndi name="java:comp/env/jdbc/mydb" />
 -->

<!ELEMENT jndi ANY>
<!ATTLIST jndi
          name CDATA #REQUIRED>
