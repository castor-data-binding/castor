            <title>Werner Guttmann Promoted to Castor JDO Lead</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item28</link>
            <description>
                After having lead Castor JDO since 2002, Bruce has decided to
                pass the torch to Werner Guttmann. Werner has been a force on 
                the project since he began contributing and his tireless efforts 
                are exactly what the project needs to continue. Congratulations, 
                Werner and keep up the great work!

            <title>New Castor roadmap</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item27</link>
            <description>
                For information about upcoming Castor releases and future development areas in general,
                please have a look at the Castor roadmap at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel
                As it stands right now, this will reveal that we have scheduled two releases (0.9.7
                and 0.9.9) within the next 5 weeks, the former designated to be a maintenance release 
                for Castor 0.9.6, the latter planned as a feature release with quite some new 
                features and improvements to be added.

            <description>
                Many of you will have recognized by now that the exolab.org 
                domain had been voided as of last Friday. As a result of this, 
                the Castor user forums are not available. Please accept our apologies 
                for any inconvenience you are experiencing, and rest assured that 
                we are working to get it back online as soon as possible.

            <title>New issue tracking tool</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item25</link>
            <description>
                This is to announce that we finally moved our issue tracking tool from
                http://bugzilla.exolab.org to the Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org), 
                migrating to Jira at the same time. We'd like to offer our apologies 
                for any inconvenience you experienced as a result of this migration 
                and hope that you like our new home for tracking (and resolving) issues
                at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/CASTOR as much as we do.

            <description>
                This is to announce that we now provide unified instructions on 
                how to submit a patch at http://castor.codehaus.org/how-to-submit-a-bug.html. 
                In addition, we have added a template for Castor JDO related patches
                to the CVS sources.

            <title>Support for polymorphism - A test drive</title>
            <link>http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html#item23</link>
            <description>
                One of the major short-comings of Castor JDO always has been missing support for 
                polymorphism. As of last week, most of the work has been finished, and we are now 
                in a position where we'd like to ask you, our users, for feedback. I've made 
                available binaries at http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/previews/0.9.6_with_polymorphism/. 
                Please use the source distribution if possible, as it contains the tests mentioned above 
                as well.

            <description>
                This is to announce that we finally moved our mailing lists to the 
                Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org). For a period of 14 days, we'll be monitoring 
                the old lists at Exolab, mainly referring you to the lists mentioned above. After 
                this period, we will turn off these lists at our discretion. For details, please
                see http://castor.codehaus.org/news.html.

            <description>After over five years of Exolab (http://www.exolab.org)sponsoring Castor, 
                the Castor team recently decided to move the entire project to a new home over at 
                the Codehaus (http://www.codehaus.org). The team would like to thank Exolab and it's 
                parent company Intalio, Inc. for it's long-standing support of the project.
