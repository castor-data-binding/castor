         In order to build the Sping ORM module for Castor JDO, you will have 
         the following requirements met on your system:

      <para>
        As this project uses Maven 2 for build and deployment, all required 
        compile-time dependencies will automatically be resolved by Maven 2
        and deployed into your local Maven 2 repository.

        <title>Building the Spring ORM module</title>
        
        <para>
            This section describes how to build the Spring module from a command 
            line using Maven 2. Whilst there is support for Maven 2 in various
            IDEs (including e.g. Eclipse, IDEA, etc.), using the Maven command 
            line seems to be the most adequate least common denominator.
        </para>
           
        <para>
            This section assumes that you have ckecked out the latest sources
            from the SVN repsitory for the Spring ORM module for Castor JDO.
            Instructions for doing so are provided 
            <ulink url="source-repository.html">here</ulink>.
        </para>
           
        <para>
            Open a command line (shell) on your system, and issue the following 
            commands:
        </para>
           
        <programlisting>
 > mvn jar            
        </programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Above command will compile the sources and create the distribution JAR
            in the <literal>target</literal> directory of the project root.
        </para>
           
        <para>
           To install the newly created distribution JAR into your local Maven 2
           repository, please issue the following command:
        </para>
           
        <programlisting>
 > mvn install            
        </programlisting>
        
        <para>
           To create the complete project documentation - in addition to
           the distribution assembly, please issue ...
