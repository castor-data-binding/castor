   <section title="Build Number 19990820    August, 20 1999"><pre>

   fixed bug with xsl:number
   with level set to any, to many counts were being generated, instead of a list
   of length one, containing one plus the number of nodes,
   a list of length NodeSet#size was being created with each node count.

   <section title="Build Number 19990818     August, 18 1999"><pre>

   added support for global variables that reference other global variables
   not yet declared.
   
   fixed a bug with processing global variables.
   I am storing the global variable declarations in a hashtable.
   This could cause the variables to be processed out of order, since
   hashtables are not ordered. So if one variable referenced another one,
   before it was defined, the result was "undefined".
   I fixed this, by adding in the required support for out-of-order processing,
   which I had not yet implemented.
   
   thanks a bunch to Roger for enabling me to find this bug.

   </pre></section>

   <section title="Build Number 19990816    August, 16 1999"><pre>

   patched bug caused by XML for Java 1.1.x.
   
   Attr nodes with the same name, hash to the same value. This appears
   to be fixed with IBM's 2.x version
   
   This causes the document order of attributes with the same name to be
   the same, and therefor causes improper document order sorting, and
   the same id was being generated for these nodes.
  
   Added Michel Casabianca's additions to HTMLPrinter for more HTML elements
   that shouldn't print end elements

   </pre></section>

      this Formatter is used by Default when no Formatter is specified
      and the result-ns is not equal to "html" or begin with
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html"
      
      all empty elements are printed using the empty element convention
