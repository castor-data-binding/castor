 * PreparedStatementMock object to test QueryContext.
 * <br/>
 * We need to implement this mock with an invocation handler as the implemented
 * interface java.sql.PreparedStatement has changed from Java 5 to Java 6. With
 * this change not only new methods have been added but also new classes has been
 * introduced which are referenced by PreparedStatement.
