    <section title="About the Castor Project">


      <p>The Castor project has been developed out of need: the need to get stuff done
         and the need to write useful code. It has been designed and coded over many cups
         of Latte and tall Americano, as proof that coffee beans do come in handy.</p>

      <p>For <a href="contributors.xml">a full list of contributors</a>.</p>

      <p>Most of the code released through the Castor Project has been developed by
         <a href="mailto:kvisco@intalio.com">Keith Visco</a>, Chief XML Architect,
         Intalio Inc. and <a href="mailto:arkin@intalio.com">Assaf Arkin</a>.
         Contributors are welcome to join this project. Please join us on the
         <a href="lists.xml">mailing list</a>.</p>
