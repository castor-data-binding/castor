    <section title="Introduction">
       <p>
       Castor is an open-source product. This means that the source code is
       available at no charge and may be obtained using <a href="cvs.xml">CVS</a> or
       <a href="download.xml">downloaded</a>
       via our ftp server.
       </p>
       <p>
       Since castor is freely available, including the source code,
       there is no guaranteed level of support available. The online

       the best place to start. If you have trouble or have more advanced
       questions not available in the online documentation then please subscribe
       to the <a href="lists.xml">castor dev or user mailing lists</a> or join the
       <a href="/phpBB2">Castor Forums</a>. The lists and forums are the best
       place to ask questions about the product.
