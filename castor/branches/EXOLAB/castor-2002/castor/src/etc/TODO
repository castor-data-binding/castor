* ObjectDesc/PrimaryKeyDesc are cloning return arrays to assure it is immutable
  and prevent the caller from changing their contents. This practice must be
  deprecated and checks made to assure these arrays are not altered, or use an
  immutable return collection.

* Check that required fields are not null prior to storing object.
  Use default values when creating a new empty object.

* OID might need to clone the original primary key used at load, or
  the dirty image should do that?
