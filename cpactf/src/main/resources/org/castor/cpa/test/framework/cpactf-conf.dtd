<!--
    The named test suite configurations specify the mapping between Java classes
    and tables in that database server.

    The class mapping is included from an external mapping file, allowing
    multiple mappings to be included in the same configuration, as well as two
    configurations to share the same mappings. For concurrency and integrity
    reasons, two configurations should never attempt to use overlapping mappings.

    A real database configuration to be used by castor is build by combining
    the mappings of the test suite configuration with one of the database
    definitions and one of the transaction definitions. The test suite
    configuration to be used is loaded by the test case by its name while
    database and transaction definitions are defined by the default element or
    specified at command line.

<!--
    The named database configurations specify the means to obtain a connection
    to the database server. The test suite will access the database by its given
    name.

    The means to acquire a database connection is specified in one of three ways:
    as a JDBC 2.0 driver and URL, as a JDBC 2.0 DataSource, or as a DataSource
    to lookup through JNDI. When Castor is used inside a J2EE application server
    it is recommended to use the JNDI lookup, allowing the application server to
    manage connection pooling and distributed transaction.

    The engine attribute specifies the persistence engine for this database
    server. Different database servers vary in the SQL syntax and capabilites
    they support, and this attribute names the service provider to use.

    The following names are supported in Castor:

    db2          DB/2
    derby        Derby
    hsql         Hypersonic SQL
    mysql        MySQL
    oracle       Oracle 7 - Oracle 9i
    pointbase    Pointbase
    postgresql   PostgreSQL 7.1
    progress     Progress
    sapdb        SAP DB / MaxDB
    sql-server   Microsoft SQL Server
    sybase       Sybase 11

<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 driver for obtaining new connections to the database
    server. The driver is obtained from the JDBC DriverManager and must be
    located in the class path.

    The JDBC URL locates the driver and provides the access properties.
    Additional properties may be specified using the param element (e.g. buffer
    size, network protocol, etc).

    Use the class-name attribute to specify the driver class for automatic
    registration with the JDBC DriverManager. If missing, the driver must be
    registered in any other means, including properties file, Class.forName(),
    etc.

    For example, to configure an Oracle 8 thin driver, use:

    <driver class-name="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver"
            url="jdbc:oracle:thin:@machine:port:SID">
      <param name="user" value="scott" />
      <param name="password" value="tiger" />
    </driver>

    When running Castor inside a J2EE application server, it is recommended to
    use jndi.

<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 DataSource for obtaining new connections to the
    database server. DataSources are defined in the JDBC 2.0 standard extension
    API which is included with Castor, and implement the interface
    javax.sql.DataSource.

    The DataSource implementation class name is specified in the class-name
    attribute and configured through Bean-like accessor methods specified by
    the param elements.

    For example, to configure a PostgreSQL 7.0 DataSource, use:

    <data-source class-name="org.postgresql.PostgresqlDataSource">
      <param name="host" value="host" />
      <param name="database" value="db" />
      <param name="user" value="user" />
      <param name="password" value="secret" />
    </data-source>

    When running Castor inside a J2EE application server, it is recommended to
    use jndi.

<!--
    Specifies the JDBC 2.0 DataSource for obtaining new connections to the
    database server through JNDI lookup. The JNDI environment naming context is
    used to obtain a suitable DataSource.

    When running inside a J2EE application server, this is the preferred method
    for obtaining database connections. It enables the J2EE application server
    to configure the connection, maintain a connection pool, and manage
    distributed transactions.

    For example, to specify a J2EE DataSource, use:

      <jndi name="java:comp/env/jdbc/mydb" />
 -->

<!ELEMENT jndi EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST jndi

<!--
    Specifies the named transaction definitions available. The mode can either
    be 'local' or 'global'. When using 'local' mode a 'manager' element will be
    ignored, while it is required for 'global' mode. A 'description' element
    telling what the transaction definition is intended for can optionally be
    specified once.
    
    When using Castor JDO stand-alone and you want Castor to control transaction
    demarcation, please use this element as follows:

       <transaction name="local" mode="local"/>
       
    When running inside a J2EE application server, and you want to use container
    managed transactions, please make sure you use this element as follows:
    
       <transaction name="jndi" mode="global">
         <manager name="jndi">
           <param name="jndiEnc" value="java:comp/env/TransactionManager" />
         </manager>
       </transaction>

<!--
    Specifies the transaction manager to use. This should be used together with
    global transaction demarcation only.

    The following transaction manager (tm) names are supported in Castor:

    jndi         TM looked up in the JNDI ENC.
	jotm         JOTM
    websphere    WebSphere 4 and previous releases.
    websphere5   WebSphere 5.
    websphere51  WebSphere 5.1.

	In addition to specifying the transaction manager name, it is possible to
    pass arbitrary name/value pairs to the transaction manager instance. This
	can be used to e.g. specify what JNDI ENC to use to lookup the transaction 
	manager.
	
       <transaction mode="global">
         <manager name="jndi">
           <param name="jndiEnc" value="java:comp/env/TransactionManager" />
