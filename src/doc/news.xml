                We are proud to participate in the 
                <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code initiative</a>
                sponsored by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, and you 
                are invited to join in the fun.<br/><br/>
                
                At 
                <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/CASTOR/CastorSocProjects">Codehaus</a>,
                you'll find some suggestions we find suitable for the program, and per
                definition we would be glad to support a few projects.<br/><br/>
                
                Please understand, though, that mentoring capacities will be limited,
                though we will try to dedicate as much time as possible to the suggested
                projects. That implies that we depend on your dedication during the
                preparation of the detailed specification and description of the outcome.<br/><br/>
                
                The timeframe for applications is May 1 - May 8. So have a look at the
                projects at offer, before you are sign up to the program and apply as a
                student to be mentored by us.

                On April 14. 2006 we have migrated Castor source repository from CVS
                to SVN. At the moment we still have read only access to CVS but this
                does not reflect commits to SVN after the migration. The read only
                access to CVS is intended for you to create patches of your current
                work and move it over to SVN. Be aware that we will switch off CVS soon.

                For details about SVN access please have a look at:

            <title>Support for polymorphism - A test drive</title>

            <summary>
                One of the major short-comings of Castor JDO always has been missing support for 
                polymorphism. After the 0.9.6 release back in Februray, which mainly focused on bug 
                fixing, we decided to tackle this missing feature and start work for adding 
                support for polymorphism to Castor JDO. For a complete history of the work done so 
                far and the tests conducted, please have a look at 
                <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=CASTOR-1018">bug 1881</a>.<br/><br/>

                As of last week, most of the work (originally initiated by myself) has been 
                finished, and we are now in a position where we'd like to ask you, our users, 
                for feedback. In other words, we think that the current implementation is stable enough 
                to make it available as described below. But as we want to get this new feature 
                as stable as possible before heading for a new release (most likely 0.9.7, but 
                maybe 1.0), we now need feedback from our users.<br/><br/>

                To facilitate this, I've made available binaries 
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/castor/previews/0.9.6_with_polymorphism/">here</a>. 
                Please use the source distribution if possible, as it contains the tests mentioned above 
                as well.
