				I'm getting an error about 'xml' prefix already
				declared?
			</title>
			<note>
			    <para>For Castor 0.9.5.2 only</para>
			</note>
			<para>
				The issue occurs with newer versions of Xerces than the
				version 1.4 that ships with Castor. The older version
				works OK. For some reason, when the newer version of
				Xerces encounters an "xml" prefixed attribute, such as
				"xml:lang", it tries to automatically start a prefix
				mapping for "xml". Which, in my opinion, is technically
				incorrect. They shouldn't be doing that. According to
				the w3c, the "xml" prefix should never be declared.
			</para>
			<para>
				The reason it started appearing in the new Castor
				(0.9.5.2), is because of a switch to SAX 2 by default
				during unmarshaling.

			<para>
				<emphasis role="bold">Solution:</emphasis>
				A built in work-around has been checked into the Castor
				SVN and will automatically exist in any post 0.9.5.2
				releases. For those who are using 0.9.5.2 and can't
				upgrade, I found a simple workaround (tested with Xerces
				2.5). At first I thought about disabling namespace
				processing in Xerces, but then realized that it's
				already disabled by default by Castor ... so I have no
				idea why they call #startPrefixMapping when namespace
				processing has been disabled. But in any event...
				explicitly enabling namespace processing seems to fix
				the problem:

		<title>What is the order of the marshalled XML elements?</title>

			reflection API.

				Is it true that the use of Castor XML mandates Xerces as
				XML parser?
			</title>

			<para>
				Yes and no. It actually depends. When requiring
				<emphasis role="italic">pretty printing</emphasis>
				during marshalling, Castor will internally use Apache's
				Xerces to implement this feature. As such, when not
				using this feature, Xerces is not a requirement, and any
				JAXP-compliant XML parser can be used (for
				unmarshalling).
			</para>

				In other words, with the latter use case, you do
				<emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis>
				have to download (and use) Xerces separetely.

		<section>
			<title>
				Do I still have to download Xerces when using Castor XML
				with Java 5.0?
			</title>

			<para>
				No. Starting with release 1.1, we have added support for
				using the Xerces instance as shipped with the JRE/JDK
				for serialization. As such, for Java 5.0 users, this
				removes the requirement to download Xerces separately
				when wanting to use 'pretty printing' with Castor XML
				during marshalling.
			</para>

			<para>
				To enable this feature, please change the following
				properties in your
