			Castor XML is an XML data binding framework. Unlike the two
			main XML APIs, DOM (Document Object Model) and SAX (Simple
			API for XML) which deal with the structure of an XML
			document, Castor enables one to deal with the data defined
			in an XML document through an object model which represents
			that data.
		</para>
		<para>
			Castor XML can marshal almost any "bean-like" Java Object to
			and from XML. In most cases the marshalling framework uses a
			set of ClassDescriptors and FieldDescriptors to describe how
			an Object should be marshalled and unmarshalled from XML.
		</para>
		<para>
			For those not familiar with the terms "marshal" and
			"unmarshal", it's simply the act of converting a stream
			(sequence of bytes) of data to and from an Object. The act
			of "marshalling" consists of converting an Object to a
			stream, and "unmarshalling" from a stream to an Object.
		</para>

		<title>Castor XML - The XML data binding framework</title>
		<para>
			The XML data binding framework, as it's name implies, is
			responsible for doing the conversion between Java and XML.
			The framework consists of two worker classes,
			<classname>org/exolab/castor/xml/Marshaller</classname>	and
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
			respectively, and a bootstrap class
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext</classname>
			used for configuration of the XML data binding framework and
			instantiation of the two worker objects.
		</para>

		<para>
			Lets walk through a very simple example. Assume we have a
			simple
			<classname>Person</classname>
			class as follows:
		</para>

		<programlisting language="java">
import java.util.Date;

/** An simple person class */ public class Person implements
java.io.Serializable {

/** The name of the person */ private String name = null;

/** The Date of birth */ private Date dob = null;

/** Creates a Person with no name */ public Person() {
super(); }

/** Creates a Person with the given name */ public
Person(String name) { this.name = name; }

/** * @return date of birth of the person */ public Date
getDateOfBirth() { return dob; }

/** * @return name of the person */ public String getName()
{ return name; }

/** * Sets the date of birth of the person * @param name the
name of the person */ public void setDateOfBirth(Date dob) {
this.dob = dob; }

/** * Sets the name of the person * @param name the name of
the person */ public void setName(String name) { this.name =
name; } }
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			To (un-)marshal data to and from XML, Castor XML can be used
			in one of three modes:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>introspection mode</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>mapping mode</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>descriptor mode (aka generation mode)</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			The following sections discuss each of these modes at a high
			level.
		</para>

		<section>
			<title>Introspection mode</title>

			<para>
				The
				<emphasis role="italic">introspection mode</emphasis>
				is the simplest mode to use from a user perspective, as
				it does not require any configuration from the user. As
				such, the user does not have to provide any mapping
				file(s), nor point Castor to any generated descriptor
				classes (as discussed in the 'descriptor mode' section).
			</para>

			<para>
				In this mode, the user makes use of
				<emphasis role="bold">static</emphasis>
				methods on the
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname> and
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
				classes, providing all required data as parameters on
				these method calls.
			</para>

			<para>
				To marshal an instance of the person class you simply
				call the
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname>
				as follows:
			</para>

			<programlisting language="java">
// Create a new Person
Person person = new Person("Ryan 'Mad Dog' Madden");
person.setDateOfBirth(new Date(1955, 8, 15));

// Create a File to marshal to
writer = new FileWriter("test.xml");

// Marshal the person object
Marshaller.marshal(person, writer);
			</programlisting>

			<para>
				This produces the XML shown in
				<xref linkend="xml.framework.introspection.ouput" />
			</para>

			<example id="xml.framework.introspection.ouput">
				<title>XML produced in introspection mode</title>
				<programlisting language="xml">
XML to written
				</programlisting>
			</example>

			<para>
				To unmarshal an instance of the person class from XML,
				you simply call the
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
				as follows:
			</para>

			<programlisting language="java">
// Create a Reader to the file to unmarshal from
reader = new FileReader("test.xml");

// Marshal the person object
Person person = (Person)
Unmarshaller.unmarshal(Person.class, reader);
			</programlisting>

			<para>
				Marshalling and unmarshalling is basically that simple.
			</para>

			<note>
				Note: The above example uses the
				<emphasis role="italic">
					<emphasis role="bold">static</emphasis>
				</emphasis>
				methods of the marshalling framework, and as such no
				Marshaller and/or Unmarshaller instances need to be
				created. A common mistake in this context when using a
				<emphasis role="bold">mapping file</emphasis>
				is to call the
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname>	or
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
				as in the above example. This won't work, as the mapping
				will be ignored.
			</note>

			<para>
				In
				<emphasis role="italic">introspection mode</emphasis>
				, Castor XML uses Java reflection to establish the
				binding between the Java classes (and their properties)
				and the XML, following a set of (default) naming rules.
				Whilst it is possible to change to a different set of
				naming rules, there's no way to override this (default)
				naming for individual artifacts. In such a case, a
				<emphasis role="italic">mapping file</emphasis>
				should be used.
			</para>

		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Mapping mode</title>

			<para>
				In
				<emphasis role="italic">mapping mode</emphasis>
				, the user provides Castor XML with a user-defined
				mapping (in form of a mapping file) that allows the
				(partial) definition of a customized mapping between
				Java classes (and their properties) and XML.
			</para>

			<para>
				When you are using a mapping file, create an instance of
				the
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext</classname>
				class and use the
				<methodname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext.addMapping(Mapping)</methodname>
				method to provide Castor XML with one of more mapping
				files.
			</para>


			<para>
				To start using Castor XML for marshalling and/or
				unmarshalling based upon your custom mapping, create
				instances of
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname>
				and
				<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
				as needed using one of the following methods:

			XMLContext - A consolidated way to bootstrap Castor
		</title>

		<para>
			With Castor 1.1.2, the
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext</classname>
			class has been added to the Castor marshalling framework.
			This new class provides a bootstrap mechanism for Castor
			XML, and allows easy (and efficient) instantiation of
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname>
			and
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
			instances as needed.
		</para>

		<para>
			As shown above, the
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext</classname>
			class offers various factory methods to obtain a new
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Marshaller</classname>,
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>.
		</para>

		<para>
			When you need more than one
			<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.Unmarshaller</classname>
			instance in your application, please call
			<methodname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLContext.createUnmarshaller()</methodname>
			as required. As all
			<literal>Unmarshaller</literal>
			instances are created from the very same
			<literal>XMLContext</literal>
			instance, overhead will be minimal. Please note, though,
			that use of one
			<literal>Unmarshaller</literal>
			instance is not thread-safe.

		<title>Using existing Classes/Objects</title>

		<para>
			Castor can marshal "almost" any arbitrary Object to and from
			XML. When descriptors are not available for a specfic Class,
			the marshalling framework uses reflection to gain
			information about the object.
		</para>
		<note>
			Actually an in memory set of descriptors are created for the
			object and we will soon have a way for saving these
			descriptors as Java source, so that they may be modified and
			compiled with little effort.
		</note>
		<para>
			If a set of descriptors exist for the classes, then Castor
			will use those to gain information about how to handle the
			marshalling. See <xref linkend="xml.framework.class.descriptors"/>
			for more information.
		</para>
		<para>
			There is one main restrictions to marshalling objects. These
			classes must have have a public default constructor (ie. a
			constructor with no arguments) and adequete "getter" and
			"setter" methods to be properly be marshalled and
			unmarshalled.
		</para>
		<para>
			The example illustrated in the previous section
			<xref linkend="xml.framework.data.binding.framework"/>
			demonstrates how to use the framework with existing classes.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="xml.framework.class.descriptors">
		<title>Class Descriptors</title>

		<para>
			Class descriptors provide the "Castor Framework" with
			necessary information so that the Class can be marshalled
			properly. The class descriptors can be shared between the
			JDO and XML frameworks.
		</para>
		<para>
			Class descriptors contain a set of
			<xref linkend="xml.framework.field.descriptors" />

		</para>
		<para>
			XML Class Descriptors are created in four main ways. Two of
			these are basically run-time, and the other two are compile
			time.

			<section>
				<title>Compile-Time Descriptors</title>
				<para>
					To use "compile-time" class descriptors, one can
					either implement the
					<classname>org.exolab.castor.xml.XMLClassDescriptor</classname>
					interface for each class which needs to be
					"described", or have the
					<ulink url="http://www.castor.org/sourcegen.xml">Source Code Generator</ulink>
					create the proper descriptors.
				</para>
				<para>
					The main advantage of compile-time descriptors is
					that they are faster than the run-time approach.
				</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Run-Time Descriptors</title>
				<para>
					To use "run-time" class descriptors, one can either
					simply let Castor introspect the classes, a mapping
					file can be provided, or a combination of both
					"default introspection" and a specified mapping file
					may be used.
				</para>
				<para>
					For "default introspection" to work the class being
					introspected must have adequete setter/getter
					methods for each field of the class that should be
					marshalled and unmarshalled. If no getter/setter
					methods exist, Castor can handle direct field access
					to public fields. It does not do both at the same
					time. So if the respective class has any
					getter/setter methods at all, then no direct field
					access will take place.
				</para>
				<para>
					There is nothing to do to enable "default
					introspection". If a descriptor cannot be found for
					a class, introspection occurs automatically.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some behavior of the introspector may be controlled
					by setting the appropriate properties in the
					<emphasis role="italic">castor.properties</emphasis>
					file. Such behavior consists of changing the naming
					conventions, and whether primitive types are treated
					as attributes or elements. See
					<emphasis role="italic">castor.properties</emphasis>
					file for more information.
				</para>
				<para>
					A mapping file may also be used to "describe" the
					classes which are to be marshalled. The mapping is
					loaded before any marshalling/unmarshalling takes
					place. See
					<classname>org.exolab.castor.mapping.Mapping</classname>
				</para>
				<para>
					The main advantage of run-time descriptors is that
					it takes very little effort to get something
					working.
